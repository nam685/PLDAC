But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection.

This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old.

These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents.

Stage 1 can be divided into Stage 1A and Stage 1B. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller).

1,Give me some examples.,Give me some examples of organisms that have adapted to exploit natural wildfire.,How can fires help an ecosystem?,How can fires help an ecosystem?,"How can fires help an ecosystem? ||| Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal. [1] Many plant species in fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce. Wildfire suppression not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them. [2]Campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.","How can fires help an ecosystem? ||| Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal.

Farming is major cause of desertification - soils need time to rest between crops but pressures to provide food and an income often lead to soil and land being over used and becoming tired. Soil also requires fertilisation to remain fertile, preferably through natural or organic processes. Where farming is carried out in a way that is unsympathetic to the land in places where climatic conditions mean the soil is already under stress, this can eventually result in desertification.

Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing. Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes ""permaculture"", originally being a combination of the words ""permanent"" and ""agriculture"", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier eco","What does it mean for soil to be tired? ||| Section::::Regenerative agriculture.

Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online.

Sure, full-fat dairy products taste better than the skim/fat-free versions, but I don’t eat them for the taste. I eat full-fat dairy because it’s better for my health and my weight. Yep, you heard me right: I eat dairy products with all the fat god gave ‘em, and I do it because it’s good for me. Here’s why:1. Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble. So you can’t absorb them from milk when all the fat has been skimmed off. (This makes fortified skim milk the biggest sham of all — you can pump fat-free milk full of a year’s supply of vitamins A and D, but the body can’t access them).3. ||| What about an alternative.

To do so, they compared the health benefits of the four most popular alternative milks, including soy, almond, coconut and rice. They examined the number of calories and amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates found in each. They also looked into the vitamins and minerals the substitutes contained. While they said cow’s milk still has the most nutritional value, with 8 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 11.5 grams of carbs, soy is the most comparable for overall balance. It’s “a clear winner,” they wrote in a statement. It has more protein than all the other milk options analyzed","No, the vegan ones.

Why? ||| Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (""Avena spp."") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

Which one would be the best to use? ||| One cup of soy milk provides 4 grams of unsaturated fat, 1 gram of fiber, and 7 grams of protein. Soymilk has 75% more antioxidants than cow’s milk. It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job.

The result resembles milk in color, texture, and flavor. Hemp is conducive to being organically grown and labeled. Plain hemp milk may be additionally sweetened or flavored. Section::::Production. Production of hemp milk requires hemp seeds, water, and a blender. Many recipes call for ground vanilla or vanilla extract to add flavor, and a type of sweetener. Once all the ingredients are blended together, some people pour the hemp milk through a cheesecloth and strainer to get a smoother and more refined milky texture, but this process is optional. Section::::Use in coffee. Compared to soy milk, in coffee culture, hemp milk is said to produce better latte art and to have a texture more like cow's milk. Section::::Nutrition.

There are five professional classes of dragsters. They are top fuel dragster, top fuel funny car, pro modified, pro stock, and pro stock bike. Of these, top fuel and funny cars are the most popular. Top fuel dragsters are the fastest class of dragsters, capable of reaching speeds of up to 150 m/s. Funny cars are basically top fuel dragsters with a body over the chassis. As a result, funny cars are usually slower than top fuelers. Top fuel dragsters frequently reach speeds of 134 m/s (300 mph) during their runs. The current speed record for any dragster is 150.27 m/s (336.15 mph) by a top fuel dragster on a run by Tony Schumacher on May 5, 2005. Class E. T.

Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966,","What is the origin of funny cars?

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance.

Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.",How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.,"How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.","How do genes work? ||| However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene."

The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.

[Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer.

And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‘Off’? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-stud","What’s the difference between the CRISPR CRISPRi and CAS13b systems? ||| What Is CRISPR?

Recently published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene.

Ferritin, a protein, serves as a storage form of iron that when low indicates iron deficiency. Your physician interprets your ferritin test results and recommends improving your ferritin levels when tests indicate they are low. With some know-how and dietary changes, you can improve your iron intake so that your ferritin levels increase.1Consume a wide variety of iron-rich foods. Following a restrictive diet that omits many foods increases your risk of having low ferritin. There are two forms of iron – animal foods contain heme iron, while plants contain non-heme iron.

Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts.

Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the ""Magnificat"" and ""Nunc Dimittis"", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models. Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles.

How is Christian poetry defined? ||| How are literary devices used in Biblical poetry?,"Okay. How does the use of rhyme in Biblical poetry compare? ||| The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern.

Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States.

How is it related to this movement? ||| A central question is: Can #BlackLivesMatter protests effect meaningful change in government? My book, “Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,” examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives.

Drawing from the book’s findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why p","There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier.

He kept shaking and shaking ... and then we saw an ant waltz out of his ear. There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully. Pay particularly close attention to the ears. Some culprits are obvious and easy to deal with. Some require attention of your veterinarian.

Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of anoth",I just checked my dog’s ears and there’s swelling in the outer portion.

What could be wrong?,"How dangerous could these be? ||| Each hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

How can I treat it at home? ||| Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). ||| How dangerous could these be? ||| Each hospital is different though and y","I live in a remote area.

Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty’s ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store. Add several drops to the kitty’s ears once daily for 21 days. The oils have a healing effect so if your kitty has inflamed or painful ears, this will help. These are the best remedies for cats with ear mites and now you can choose the conventional or the holistic approach. Your cat will feel much better and she will love you for it. ||| I live in a remote area. How can I treat it","My cat is also having similar symptoms to my dog.

Jackson’s relationship to his skin was complicated from a young age, Knopper reports: The Jackson brothers teased each other mercilessly about their appearances. Michael’s nose was the source of his early nickname, as Jermaine’s acne was for him. The Jacksons had been subject to intense media scrutiny starting when they were very young and that meant Michael had to go through puberty in the public eye, a process that included media scrutiny of his blemishes. Nancy Leiviska, who worked with MTV, set Jermaine and Michael up with a dermatologist, and both Jacksons became vegetarians in an effort to fight acne through their diets. Michael would later have procedures to try to limit the appearance of his acne scars.

While filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984, Jackson was badly burned during the sixth take of the ad. He had to have skin grafts and balloons implanted in his scalp as part of his recovery. In an attempt to ease his ongoing discomfort, a plastic surgeon tried to eliminate some of Jackson’s scar tissue. “For this procedure, as well as Michael’s continuing struggles with discoid lupus and acne scarring— plus his continuing experiments with his nose, chin, and cheekbones— Klein and Debbie Rowe administ","What else was Michael Jackson’s vexed relationship to his skin about? ||| In 1983, Arnold Klein, his dermatologist, observed not only that Jackson had vitiligo, the condition that would lead Jackson to bleach his skin, but also diagnosed Jackson with discoid lupus erythematosus.

It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus.

An estimated54 percent of American adults drink coffee every day, and tea won't suffice. Coffee is an exotic plant that can only be grown in very specific ecosystems thousands of miles away, but we've come to see it as a daily staple, and many Americans who depend on drinking it will do so regardless of price increases. There are also longer-term problems that might cause coffee prices to continue rising in the coming years. One is that substantial solutions to the problems of drought and coffee rust take time.

The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been adequately forthcoming about his medical records. At a debate in Las Vegas this month, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said Sanders needs to disclose “full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout.” The Sanders campaign says demanding greater detail on Sanders’s health resembles “the kind of smear” that demands for Barack Obama’s birth certificate represented. It’s easy to understand why Sanders is not eager to release more of his health history. He’s a 78-year-old who weighs 179 pounds and recently had a heart attack. And he’s not the only one. Of the major Democratic candidates, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have released comprehensive medical reports.

In the time I’ve been alive, the average age for becoming a father in America has climbed 3 1 / 2 years, to 30.9, and higher for the college-educated. But that doesn’t mean we’re older versions of our dads. Just as the boomers who came after my dad discovered jogging and yoga and aerobics, my generation of parents has found its own approach to fitness.

Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a","Okay.

A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation.

You can beat yourself into the ground with weight training just as well as with cardio. To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness. Every person has a different body type, and different body types are naturally better suited to different exercises. Some people do not do well with cardio, and that’s perfectly fine: just don’t do it.

A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4.

It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you’re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two. It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique. It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia.

Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments.

There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground.

That makes me, I suppose, the Jekyll and Hyde of holidayers. Luckily, my partner — who is the boss not only of her two boys but also of me — shares my dual mind-set. Accordingly, my family and I began our recent trip to Italy with an educational visit to Rome and Pompeii and ended with a sybaritic idyll on the Amalfi Coast. The weather, food and amenities were all perfect. The only problem is that a lot of people had the same idea. August being the height of the high season, we predictably had to battle our way through hordes of fellow tourists. Yet not even overcrowding (or the political chaos in Rome) can spoil Bella Italia.

People shuffled into the plentiful limoncello shops and gathered on the steep staircase leading to the Duomo di Sant’ Andrea, the 9th-century Romanesque cathedral that stands at the heart of the town. Keeping a watchful eye over the plaza were an elderly couple, high on their top-floor balcony. Wrapped in snug dressing gowns, the pair surveyed the scene in silence. Amalfi’s surge in popularity began in Edwardian times, when wealthy families from across Europe deemed it a pleasant place to spend their winters. By the 1950s, it had gained a reputation for glamour and sophistication. Today, it attracts travelers in search of fine food, eye-popping scenery and weather that’s nothing short of sublime.

What’s that? ||| A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area. One popular way to do this was by constructing massive buildings that req","What is the Duomo on the Amalfi Coast? ||| A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located.

Some cities offer financial incentives for using rainwater for irrigation as a supplement to municipal water. Caution Check for restrictions on rain barrels and rain harvesting in your area. You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternative","Maybe I could collect it for my garden.

How big should it be? How much can I save? ||| Buy a rain barrel Seattle Rain Barrel User's Guide (pdf) - Learn more, including calculating how much rain you can gather and store. How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, an","How much rainwater can I collect with a rain barrel? ||| Buy a rain barrel Seattle Rain Barrel User's Guide (pdf) - Learn more, including calculating how much rain you can gather and store. ||| Maybe I could collect it for my garden.

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime.

Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior.

The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65.

That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drin","Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned.

Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump.

Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs.

In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather.

A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology.

The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your ","That’s great.

The compressor, the “heart” of the car’s air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing c","Tell me about AC systems. ||| An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses.
