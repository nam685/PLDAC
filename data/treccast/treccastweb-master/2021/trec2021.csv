Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about.","I just had a breast biopsy for cancer.

What are common treatments? ||| Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy.","I just had a breast biopsy for cancer.

What are the most common types? ||| More research is needed. Types Breast cancer can be: Ductal carcinoma: This begins in the milk duct and is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body. Non-invasive breast cancer is when the cancer is still inside its place of origin and has not broken out. ||| Once it breaks out, how likely is it to spread? ||| Even though this condition doesn’t spread, it’s important to keep an eye on it. Between 20% to 40% of women with this condition will develop a separate invasive breast cancer -- one that will grow outside its original location -- within the next 15 years. Most of the time, these later cancers begin in the milk ducts, rather than the lobules. How is lobular carcinoma in situ diagnosed?

Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about. ||| Wow, that's better than I thought.  What are common treatments? ||| Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. ||| How does it behave differently from PLCIS? ||| Wilson said she has “vigilantly monitored” her health with mammograms and MRIs after knowing she had an “underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ).” When a recent breast biopsy revealed PLCIS (pleomorphic carcinoma in situ), initial tests showed that it was not cancerous. But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection. Last week, Taylor Swift revealed that her mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and urged her fans to remind their parents about getting screened.","I just had a breast biopsy for cancer.

This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases.","I just had a breast biopsy for cancer.

What are the most common types? ||| More research is needed. Types Breast cancer can be: Ductal carcinoma: This begins in the milk duct and is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body. Non-invasive breast cancer is when the cancer is still inside its place of origin and has not broken out. ||| Once it breaks out, how likely is it to spread? ||| Even though this condition doesn’t spread, it’s important to keep an eye on it. Between 20% to 40% of women with this condition will develop a separate invasive breast cancer -- one that will grow outside its original location -- within the next 15 years.

Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about. ||| Wow, that's better than I thought.  What are common treatments? ||| Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. ||| How does it behave differently from PLCIS? ||| Wilson said she has “vigilantly monitored” her health with mammograms and MRIs after knowing she had an “underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ).” When a recent breast biopsy revealed PLCIS (pleomorphic carcinoma in situ), initial tests showed that it was not cancerous. But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection. Last week, Taylor Swift revealed that her mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and urged her fans to remind their parents about getting screened. ||| What makes lobular cancer distinct? ||| Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases. ||| For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery? ||| Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents. Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003. Section::::Treatment.

How does agriculture affect an ecosystem? ||| Can agriculture cause desertification?,"How can fires help an ecosystem? ||| Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal. [1] Many plant species in fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce. Wildfire suppression not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them. [2]Campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire. ||| Give me some examples. ||| Not only will the number of thriving annual plants be higher after a fire, but the number of species will also be significantly higher. This is due not only to the fact that there are more resources available but also because several plant species in chaparral biomes are so adapted to the cycle of periodic fires that their seeds are only able to sprout after a fire. Photo of a chaparral ecosystem the winter after a fire For example, the seeds of a native chaparral wildflower, called whispering bells, require smoke exposure to germinate. These annual plant species are sometimes called fire-followers because they are only seen in the first couple of years following a fire when they are a part of the dominant vegetation in a chaparral ecosystem. ||| Cool name!  What are other fire-followers? ||| The longleaf pine ecosystem is known as a fire climax community. The organization group Longleaf Alliance defines a fire climax community as ""a plant and animal community that is limited by and adapted to an early successional stage by frequent fire disturbances"". The role of fire in the longleaf pine ecosystem was and still is today a key component in regeneration and shaping of the ecosystem. In pre-European establishment years, Native Americans set fires quite regularly. By doing so, they benefited their needs of establishing hunting grounds, homesteads, and safe havens. While achieving their goals, they were enriching the longleaf pine ecosystem by shaping the dynamics of the system. ||| Let’s talk about other environmental influences besides fire. More broadly, what are the effects of agriculture? ||| That agriculture has a huge effect on our ecosystems: pesticides and other toxic chemicals used in food production can wash downstream, killing many types of animals, polluting our waterways and even making humans ill. Fertilizers can wash downstream, causing """"blooms"""" or large populations of algae and bacteria, which can harm fish populations. In addition, Green Facts states that we are depleting fish populations in the oceans and seas, causing us to fish further offshore and deeper underwater as more and more fish disappear. Water Throughout the world, 2.6 billion people lack proper sanitation, which means that drinking water around the world is contaminated with waste and disease. ||| Can it cause desertification? ||| Most plants, unless specially adapted to desert conditions, can not thrive in dry, arid conditions. Farming is major cause of desertification - soils need time to rest between crops but pressures to provide food and an income often lead to soil and land being over used and becoming tired. Soil also requires fertilisation to remain fertile, preferably through natural or organic processes. Where farming is carried out in a way that is unsympathetic to the land in places where climatic conditions mean the soil is already under stress, this can eventually result in desertification.

Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing. Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes ""permaculture"", originally being a combination of the words ""permanent"" and ""agriculture"", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem.","How can fires help an ecosystem? ||| Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal.

This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire. ||| Give me some examples. ||| Not only will the number of thriving annual plants be higher after a fire, but the number of species will also be significantly higher. This is due not only to the fact that there are more resources available but also because several plant species in chaparral biomes are so adapted to the cycle of periodic fires that their seeds are only able to sprout after a fire. Photo of a chaparral ecosystem the winter after a fire For example, the seeds of a native chaparral wildflower, called whispering bells, require smoke exposure to germinate. These annual plant species are sometimes called fire-followers because they are only seen in the first couple of years following a fire when they are a part of the dominant vegetation in a chaparral ecosystem. ||| Cool name!  What are other fire-followers? ||| The longleaf pine ecosystem is known as a fire climax community. The organization group Longleaf Alliance defines a fire climax community as ""a plant and animal community that is limited by and adapted to an early successional stage by frequent fire disturbances"". The role of fire in the longleaf pine ecosystem was and still is today a key component in regeneration and shaping of the ecosystem. In pre-European establishment years, Native Americans set fires quite regularly. By doing so, they benefited their needs of establishing hunting grounds, homesteads, and safe havens. While achieving their goals, they were enriching the longleaf pine ecosystem by shaping the dynamics of the system. ||| Let’s talk about other environmental influences besides fire. More broadly, what are the effects of agriculture? ||| That agriculture has a huge effect on our ecosystems: pesticides and other toxic chemicals used in food production can wash downstream, killing many types of animals, polluting our waterways and even making humans ill. Fertilizers can wash downstream, causing """"blooms"""" or large populations of algae and bacteria, which can harm fish populations. In addition, Green Facts states that we are depleting fish populations in the oceans and seas, causing us to fish further offshore and deeper underwater as more and more fish disappear. Water Throughout the world, 2.6 billion people lack proper sanitation, which means that drinking water around the world is contaminated with waste and disease. ||| Can it cause desertification? ||| Most plants, unless specially adapted to desert conditions, can not thrive in dry, arid conditions. Farming is major cause of desertification - soils need time to rest between crops but pressures to provide food and an income often lead to soil and land being over used and becoming tired. Soil also requires fertilisation to remain fertile, preferably through natural or organic processes. Where farming is carried out in a way that is unsympathetic to the land in places where climatic conditions mean the soil is already under stress, this can eventually result in desertification. Read More: How Big a Problem is Desertification? ||| What does it mean to be tired? ||| Section::::Regenerative agriculture. Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing. Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes ""permaculture"", originally being a combination of the words ""permanent"" and ""agriculture"", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem. ||| That sounds like organic farming.  How are they related? ||| According to Permaculture Planet.com:“Permaculture is an interdisciplinary earth science which encompasses many kinds of appropriate technologies and sustainable design methodologies, such as; renewable energy, water conservation, organic food production, ecological building techniques, micro-economics and more. In a world of rapid ecological change &amp; seemingly insurmountable social &amp; environmental problems, Permaculture offers practical solutions using design principles drawn from the observation of natural systems. From individual homes to entire bio-regions, Permaculture has the potential to repair damaged landscapes, build capacity in communities and replace apathy with self empowerment.”Permaculture, when practiced, is a design philosophy and set of tools and principles that encompass the inter-related fields of organic gardening and agroforestry, architecture, ecology, community design, renewable energy, and systems theory.","How can fires help an ecosystem? ||| Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal.

Other than its destructive potential, pica can be extremely hazardous to your cat's health if non-food items are consumed. Ingested fabric, string, or other materials can lodge in your cat's stomach or intestine. The blockage prevents the passage of food and may cut off the blood supply to these organs. Both are life-threatening conditions. Cat's that chew on power cords may be electrocuted. Additionally, many common houseplants are toxic to cats; chewing or eating these plants can cause a wide range of symptoms from drooling to death. If your cat has a history of ingesting non-food items and becomes lethargic, vomits, or displays other concerning behavior, take them to your veterinarian immediately. Why Does My Cat Eat/Chew on Non-food Items? No one knows exactly why some cats exhibit pica behavior. Because pica has been associated with a variety of diseases including feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus, a veterinarian should examine any cat with pica.","Why do cats eat plastic? ||| ""The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult.

Cow Milk No matter where you are on the planet, you’ve almost certainly come across cow milk. In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals.

I’ve heard it's also made from almonds? ||| Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio.

Sure, full-fat dairy products taste better than the skim/fat-free versions, but I don’t eat them for the taste. I eat full-fat dairy because it’s better for my health and my weight. Yep, you heard me right: I eat dairy products with all the fat god gave ‘em, and I do it because it’s good for me. Here’s why:1. Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble. So you can’t absorb them from milk when all the fat has been skimmed off. (This makes fortified skim milk the biggest sham of all — you can pump fat-free milk full of a year’s supply of vitamins A and D, but the body can’t access them).3.","What are the benefits of cow milk? ||| Cow milk seems to be everywhere and is often taken for granted, but it has many important health benefits, including its ability to aid in weight loss, build strong bones and teeth, boost the immune system, reduce fat, protect the heart, prevent diabetes, eliminate inflammation, and help stimulate growth.

Cow Milk No matter where you are on the planet, you’ve almost certainly come across cow milk. In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals. Cow milk (derived from bovines) is intended for sucking by young cows, just as human infants are often nursed with human breast milk. However, the nutritional value and availability of cow’s milk have made it one of the most in-demand liquids on the planet. More than 6 billion people on the planet drink milk on a semi-regular basis, which means that these animals are an incredibly important part of our global nutritional needs. ||| What about an alternative. I’ve heard it's also made from almonds? ||| Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio.

Why? ||| Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (""Avena spp."") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

Cow Milk No matter where you are on the planet, you’ve almost certainly come across cow milk. In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals. Cow milk (derived from bovines) is intended for sucking by young cows, just as human infants are often nursed with human breast milk. However, the nutritional value and availability of cow’s milk have made it one of the most in-demand liquids on the planet. More than 6 billion people on the planet drink milk on a semi-regular basis, which means that these animals are an incredibly important part of our global nutritional needs. ||| What about an alternative. I’ve heard it's also made from almonds? ||| Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio.

Someone may owe you money To find out, researchers from Mc Gill University recently conducted an experiment, published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology, to determine the nutritional value of plant-based milk beverages. To do so, they compared the health benefits of the four most popular alternative milks, including soy, almond, coconut and rice. They examined the number of calories and amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates found in each. They also looked into the vitamins and minerals the substitutes contained. While they said cow’s milk still has the most nutritional value, with 8 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 11.5 grams of carbs, soy is the most comparable for overall balance. It’s “a clear winner,” they wrote in a statement. It has more protein than all the other milk options analyzed, with 7 to 12 grams and 95 calories a glass. ||| Can I make it at home? ||| Soy milk maker A soy milk maker is a small kitchen appliance which automatically cooks soy milk, a non-dairy beverage made from soy beans. Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages. Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products. Ordinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor-intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked). Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production. Section::::Standard operation. Before use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6–10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use. ||| Oat seems popular now.  Why? ||| Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (""Avena spp."") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA). Section::::History. Section::::History.:Creation. Soy milk predates all other alternative milks, including oat milk, both as a cultural and commercial product. ||| I’m going to bake some cookies. Which one would be the best to use? ||| One cup of soy milk provides 4 grams of unsaturated fat, 1 gram of fiber, and 7 grams of protein. Soymilk has 75% more antioxidants than cow’s milk. It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job. That means that soy milk is also the best choice when making vegan buttermilk for Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits or for dredging to make breaded dishes like “Chicken-Fried” Tofu Steaks.","What are the benefits of cow milk? ||| Cow milk seems to be everywhere and is often taken for granted, but it has many important health benefits, including its ability to aid in weight loss, build strong bones and teeth, boost the immune system, reduce fat, protect the heart, prevent diabetes, eliminate inflammation, and help stimulate growth.

Before use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6–10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use. ||| Oat seems popular now.  Why? ||| Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (""Avena spp."") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job.

Cow Milk No matter where you are on the planet, you’ve almost certainly come across cow milk. In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals. Cow milk (derived from bovines) is intended for sucking by young cows, just as human infants are often nursed with human breast milk. However, the nutritional value and availability of cow’s milk have made it one of the most in-demand liquids on the planet. More than 6 billion people on the planet drink milk on a semi-regular basis, which means that these animals are an incredibly important part of our global nutritional needs. ||| What about an alternative. I’ve heard it's also made from almonds? ||| Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio.

Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble. So you can’t absorb them from milk when all the fat has been skimmed off.

Production of hemp milk requires hemp seeds, water, and a blender. Many recipes call for ground vanilla or vanilla extract to add flavor, and a type of sweetener. Once all the ingredients are blended together, some people pour the hemp milk through a cheesecloth and strainer to get a smoother and more refined milky texture, but this process is optional.

Why do they call them that? ||| Hot Rod News Comparing Vintage and Modern Funny Cars Written by Brandan Gillogly on February 13, 2016Elana Scherr - writer; Wes Allison - photographer;View All 78 Photos The first Funny Cars showed up in the mid 1960s, how have they changed in the last half century? Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car.","I saw a Tesla Roadster today which made me wonder, what is the world’s fastest car? ||| Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video.0:00 / 2:112.

Hennessey Venom GT (270.49mph)The Hennessey Venom GT is first in our list, with a verified speed of 270.49mph. The cars comes with a 1,244-hp 7.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine giving it enough power to go at such high speeds. However, when it comes to Guinness World records Venom GT is still not considered as the fastest car in the world. The Guinness World record for the fastest car is held by the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (second car in our list) at 269.86mph. The Venom GT reached the speed of 270.49mph at the Kennedy Space Center in a one-way run (NASA didn’t allow running in the opposite direction). To break the Guinness World Record, it is compulsory to run in both directions to compensate for the wind conditions, so the Veyron Super Sport kept its title of fastest car in the world. ||| What is the first based on? ||| Section::::Specifications.:Chassis. The Venom GT utilizes a heavily modified Lotus Elise/Exige chassis. The manufacturer states that the modified chassis uses components from the Lotus Exige, including the roof, doors, side glass, windscreen, cockpit, floorpan, HVAC system, wiper and head lamps, though the manufacturer is not associated with Lotus Cars. For road use, the car is registered as a Lotus Exige (modified) and is not a series production car. The Venom GT has a curb weight of aided by carbon fiber bodywork and carbon fiber wheels. The brakes have Brembo 6-piston calipers at the front and 4-piston calipers at the rear. The rotors are carbon ceramic units provided by Surface Transforms. Section::::Specifications.:Drivetrain. The Venom GT is powered by a twin-turbocharged GM LSX V8 engine. The LSX architecture incorporates specific design features such as reinforced internal components and additional head bolts with aluminum heads including twin Precision dual ball bearing turbochargers. The engine has a power output of at 6,600 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm. ||| How fast can the unmodified base car go? ||| This was a great way to validate the technical excellence of our car which includes high-speed stability with an open roof.”The Venom GT is powered by a twin-turbo 7.0L V8 engine producing 1,451 bhp @ 7,200 rpm and 1,287 lb-ft of torque @ 4,200 rpm and puts its power down to the rear Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires via a 6-speed manual gearbox by Ricardo. The Venom GT is capable of 0-60 mph in less than 2.4 seconds and has been tested from 0-200 mph in less than 13 seconds. Hennessey plans to offer a limited run of 3 “World Record Edition” Venom GT Spyder’s to commemorate the record run and as a tribute to the company’s 25 th Anniversary. The cost is $1.3 million each plus tax.“We are grateful to have the help of so many friends, family, employees, customers and partners over the past 25 years. We look forward to the next chapter of the Venom with the F5 as we keep making fast cars faster for the next 25 years”, said John Hennessey.### ||| No, I meant the Lotus. ||| Power to weight ratio: 307 hp/tonne (311 PS/1000kg). Lotus Exige Sport 380 (2016–Present) [ edit]Lotus Exige Sport 380The Lotus Exige Sport 380 is a track focused and more powerful version of the Lotus Exige lineup. It was unveiled on 23 November 2016. Lotus' CEO, Jean-Marc Gales describes it as, """"The Exige Sport 380 is so good, that it is no longer the best in class, it’s now in a class of its own"""", and it fulfills this statement by taking on some of the powerful and expensive super cars both on the track and the streets. The 3.5-litre, super-charged V6 engine is now uprated and produces 375 hp (380 PS; 280 k W) and 410 N⋅m (302 lb⋅ft) of torque with a 6500 rpm red line achieved by revised supercharger and ECU. It can sprint from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 178 mph (286 km/h). ||| Can any go over 300 mph? ||| Instead, it is a head to head race between two cars on a short 402 m (¼ mile), straight track. There are five professional classes of dragsters. They are top fuel dragster, top fuel funny car, pro modified, pro stock, and pro stock bike. Of these, top fuel and funny cars are the most popular. Top fuel dragsters are the fastest class of dragsters, capable of reaching speeds of up to 150 m/s. Funny cars are basically top fuel dragsters with a body over the chassis. As a result, funny cars are usually slower than top fuelers. Top fuel dragsters frequently reach speeds of 134 m/s (300 mph) during their runs. The current speed record for any dragster is 150.27 m/s (336.15 mph) by a top fuel dragster on a run by Tony Schumacher on May 5, 2005. Class E. T.

Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car. ||| How fast did it go? ||| The upgraded system also improved the maximum torque from and improves the Roadster's quarter mile times. Section::::Specifications.:Transmission.:Gear selector. In the interior the gear selector is similar to a push-button automatic with buttons labeled P, R, N and D while some earlier models have a gear lever similar to that in cars with manual transmission. Section::::Specifications.:Performance. The Roadster's acceleration time is 3.9 seconds for the Standard model and 3.7 seconds for the 2010 V2.5 Sport, which ""Motor Trend"" confirmed in the first independent, instrumented testing the Sport. The magazine also recorded a time of 12.6 seconds at . Tesla said the top speed is electronically limited to . Tesla claims it has a weight of , a and a . Tesla began delivering the higher performance version of the Roadster in July 2009. The Roadster Sport has adjustable dampers and a new hand-wound motor, capable of in 3.7 seconds. Scotty Pollacheck, a high-performance driver for Killacycle, drove a 2010 Tesla Roadster Sport at the Wayland Invitational Drag Race in Portland, Oregon, in July 2009.","I saw a Tesla Roadster today which made me wonder, what is the world’s fastest car? ||| Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video.0:00 / 2:112.

The cars comes with a 1,244-hp 7.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 engine giving it enough power to go at such high speeds. However, when it comes to Guinness World records Venom GT is still not considered as the fastest car in the world. The Guinness World record for the fastest car is held by the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport (second car in our list) at 269.86mph. The Venom GT reached the speed of 270.49mph at the Kennedy Space Center in a one-way run (NASA didn’t allow running in the opposite direction). To break the Guinness World Record, it is compulsory to run in both directions to compensate for the wind conditions, so the Veyron Super Sport kept its title of fastest car in the world. ||| What is the first based on? ||| Section::::Specifications.:Chassis.

Lotus Exige Sport 380 (2016–Present) [ edit]Lotus Exige Sport 380The Lotus Exige Sport 380 is a track focused and more powerful version of the Lotus Exige lineup. It was unveiled on 23 November 2016. Lotus' CEO, Jean-Marc Gales describes it as, """"The Exige Sport 380 is so good, that it is no longer the best in class, it’s now in a class of its own"""", and it fulfills this statement by taking on some of the powerful and expensive super cars both on the track and the streets. The 3.5-litre, super-charged V6 engine is now uprated and produces 375 hp (380 PS; 280 k W) and 410 N⋅m (302 lb⋅ft) of torque with a 6500 rpm red line achieved by revised supercharger and ECU. It can sprint from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 178 mph (286 km/h). ||| Can any go over 300 mph? ||| Instead, it is a head to head race between two cars on a short 402 m (¼ mile), straight track. There are five professional classes of dragsters. They are top fuel dragster, top fuel funny car, pro modified, pro stock, and pro stock bike. Of these, top fuel and funny cars are the most popular. Top fuel dragsters are the fastest class of dragsters, capable of reaching speeds of up to 150 m/s. Funny cars are basically top fuel dragsters with a body over the chassis. As a result, funny cars are usually slower than top fuelers. Top fuel dragsters frequently reach speeds of 134 m/s (300 mph) during their runs. The current speed record for any dragster is 150.27 m/s (336.15 mph) by a top fuel dragster on a run by Tony Schumacher on May 5, 2005. Class E. T.

Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car. ||| How fast did it go? ||| The upgraded system also improved the maximum torque from and improves the Roadster's quarter mile times.

Today the Hennessey Venom GT promises to set a new standard of power to weight ratio in the rarified air of today’s supercar market.”With such a light-weight body and astronomical horsepower, the Hennessey Venom GT can sprint from 0 – 60 in just 2.2 seconds with a top speed of 262 mph on a six-speed manual transmission. Compared to the Bugatti Veyron, which has an acceleration speed from 0 – 60 mph in 2.6 seconds with a top speed of 253 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT may be the “Veyron-killer”. To stop this venomous beast, Brembo brakes with 6-piston calipers are added in front and 4-piston calipers in the rear to give enough clamping power on the massive 15-inch carbon ceramic rotors. Hennessey plans on building 10 units of the Venom GT yearly. Four Hennessey Venom GT’s have already been sold at about $600,000 each in this year.","I saw a Tesla Roadster today which made me wonder, what is the world’s fastest car? ||| Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video.0:00 / 2:112.

Lotus Exige Sport 380 (2016–Present) [ edit]Lotus Exige Sport 380The Lotus Exige Sport 380 is a track focused and more powerful version of the Lotus Exige lineup. It was unveiled on 23 November 2016. Lotus' CEO, Jean-Marc Gales describes it as, """"The Exige Sport 380 is so good, that it is no longer the best in class, it’s now in a class of its own"""", and it fulfills this statement by taking on some of the powerful and expensive super cars both on the track and the streets. The 3.5-litre, super-charged V6 engine is now uprated and produces 375 hp (380 PS; 280 k W) and 410 N⋅m (302 lb⋅ft) of torque with a 6500 rpm red line achieved by revised supercharger and ECU. It can sprint from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 3.5 seconds and has a top speed of 178 mph (286 km/h). ||| Can any go over 300 mph? ||| Instead, it is a head to head race between two cars on a short 402 m (¼ mile), straight track. There are five professional classes of dragsters. They are top fuel dragster, top fuel funny car, pro modified, pro stock, and pro stock bike. Of these, top fuel and funny cars are the most popular. Top fuel dragsters are the fastest class of dragsters, capable of reaching speeds of up to 150 m/s. Funny cars are basically top fuel dragsters with a body over the chassis. As a result, funny cars are usually slower than top fuelers. Top fuel dragsters frequently reach speeds of 134 m/s (300 mph) during their runs. The current speed record for any dragster is 150.27 m/s (336.15 mph) by a top fuel dragster on a run by Tony Schumacher on May 5, 2005. Class E. T.

Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car. ||| How fast did it go? ||| The upgraded system also improved the maximum torque from and improves the Roadster's quarter mile times.

How does its quickness compare to the Venom? ||| “Over fifty years ago the American-built P51 Mustang fighter aircraft was flown into history powered by a British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Today the Hennessey Venom GT promises to set a new standard of power to weight ratio in the rarified air of today’s supercar market.”With such a light-weight body and astronomical horsepower, the Hennessey Venom GT can sprint from 0 – 60 in just 2.2 seconds with a top speed of 262 mph on a six-speed manual transmission. Compared to the Bugatti Veyron, which has an acceleration speed from 0 – 60 mph in 2.6 seconds with a top speed of 253 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT may be the “Veyron-killer”. To stop this venomous beast, Brembo brakes with 6-piston calipers are added in front and 4-piston calipers in the rear to give enough clamping power on the massive 15-inch carbon ceramic rotors. Hennessey plans on building 10 units of the Venom GT yearly. Four Hennessey Venom GT’s have already been sold at about $600,000 each in this year. ||| It sounds like the Tesla is very competitive.

The heart of the Tesla Roadster is its 3-phase, 4-pole electric induction motor, which weighs just 70 pounds. Tesla's claims and independent testing show that the Roadster can reach 60 mph in about four seconds and its speed will top out somewhere around 130 mph. But the Roadster's performance isn't just about speed and acceleration. The unique properties of an electric motor give it a huge advantage over a combustion engine in terms of torque, force that tends to rotate or turn things, and power band, the range of operating speeds under which the engine operates efficiently. The Roadster can generate large amounts of torque even at very low RPM, and the motor can always turn out major horsepower.

There are five professional classes of dragsters. They are top fuel dragster, top fuel funny car, pro modified, pro stock, and pro stock bike. Of these, top fuel and funny cars are the most popular. Top fuel dragsters are the fastest class of dragsters, capable of reaching speeds of up to 150 m/s. Funny cars are basically top fuel dragsters with a body over the chassis. As a result, funny cars are usually slower than top fuelers. Top fuel dragsters frequently reach speeds of 134 m/s (300 mph) during their runs.

The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car. ||| How fast did it go? ||| The upgraded system also improved the maximum torque from and improves the Roadster's quarter mile times.

The Roadster's acceleration time is 3.9 seconds for the Standard model and 3.7 seconds for the 2010 V2.5 Sport, which ""Motor Trend"" confirmed in the first independent, instrumented testing the Sport. The magazine also recorded a time of 12.6 seconds at . Tesla said the top speed is electronically limited to . Tesla claims it has a weight of , a and a . Tesla began delivering the higher performance version of the Roadster in July 2009. The Roadster Sport has adjustable dampers and a new hand-wound motor, capable of in 3.7 seconds. Scotty Pollacheck, a high-performance driver for Killacycle, drove a 2010 Tesla Roadster Sport at the Wayland Invitational Drag Race in Portland, Oregon, in July 2009. ||| No, I meant the funny car.  But, that’s interesting. I heard it has a ludicrous mode. How does its quickness compare to the Venom? ||| “Over fifty years ago the American-built P51 Mustang fighter aircraft was flown into history powered by a British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Today the Hennessey Venom GT promises to set a new standard of power to weight ratio in the rarified air of today’s supercar market.”With such a light-weight body and astronomical horsepower, the Hennessey Venom GT can sprint from 0 – 60 in just 2.2 seconds with a top speed of 262 mph on a six-speed manual transmission. Compared to the Bugatti Veyron, which has an acceleration speed from 0 – 60 mph in 2.6 seconds with a top speed of 253 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT may be the “Veyron-killer”. To stop this venomous beast, Brembo brakes with 6-piston calipers are added in front and 4-piston calipers in the rear to give enough clamping power on the massive 15-inch carbon ceramic rotors. Hennessey plans on building 10 units of the Venom GT yearly. Four Hennessey Venom GT’s have already been sold at about $600,000 each in this year. ||| It sounds like the Tesla is very competitive.

The heart of the Tesla Roadster is its 3-phase, 4-pole electric induction motor, which weighs just 70 pounds. Tesla's claims and independent testing show that the Roadster can reach 60 mph in about four seconds and its speed will top out somewhere around 130 mph. But the Roadster's performance isn't just about speed and acceleration. The unique properties of an electric motor give it a huge advantage over a combustion engine in terms of torque, force that tends to rotate or turn things, and power band, the range of operating speeds under which the engine operates efficiently. The Roadster can generate large amounts of torque even at very low RPM, and the motor can always turn out major horsepower. It can reach over 13,000 RPM, something very few large combustion engines can do.” ||| I heard they’ve been working on something even faster. ||| The Roadster with Maximum Plaid Mode — a nod to a line from the Mel Brooks movie, Spaceballs — cuts that to 1.9 seconds and secures the crown. It will hit 100 in 4.2 seconds and top out “above 250 mph,” according to Musk. For gearheads, he noted the three-motor Roadster will turn out an unprecedented 7,376 pound-feet of torque, more than a diesel 18-wheeler, and 10 times what even some of the world’s most powerful gas sports cars can manage. Meanwhile, the Roadster will have a range of 620 miles of highway driving, Musk added, noting, “You’ll be able to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back without charging.”The Tesla Roadster will hit 100 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds and top out """"above 250 mph,"""" according to CEO Elon Musk.

He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying ""It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?"". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983.

After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (""ca."" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying ""It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?"". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. ||| Why are they banned? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ||| Are there visible signs? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It has also been revealed that many people who administer excessively high doses of anabolic steroids tend to experience mood, sexuality, and aggression changes during or after the use of these drugs, though these effects may be rapid or involve long-term modifications at the genomic level. ||| That sounds easy to spot.  How do they get away with it? ||| Rodchenkov combined three steroids and dissolved that mixture into liquor — Chivas whiskey for men, Martini vermouth for women — in order to speed up absorption and shorten the detection window. “The athletes were instructed to swish the liquid around in their mouths, under the tongue, to absorb the drugs,” the Times writes. Even with this subterfuge, WADA found that Russia had the highest number of athletes who were caught doping in 2014. Rodchenkov blamed that on athletes who took drugs that he had not approved. — At the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov spearheaded a clandestine, late-night effort to swap out Russian athletes’ dirty urine with clean urine provided months earlier, before the athletes began doping. With the assistance of Russian intelligence officers — who, the Times alleges, were able to develop a replacement for the tamper-proof caps used on the specimen bottles —  Rodchenkov would exchange dirty urine samples with athletes’ clean samples provided by a colleague, who was stationed in what nominally was a storage closet next door. The urine samples were passed back and forth through a hole that had been cut into the wall near the floor.","Utterance: What’s the history of steroid use in sports in the US? ||| Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year.

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (""ca."" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying ""It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?"". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. ||| Why are they banned? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ||| Are there visible signs? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It has also been revealed that many people who administer excessively high doses of anabolic steroids tend to experience mood, sexuality, and aggression changes during or after the use of these drugs, though these effects may be rapid or involve long-term modifications at the genomic level. ||| That sounds easy to spot.  How do they get away with it? ||| Rodchenkov combined three steroids and dissolved that mixture into liquor — Chivas whiskey for men, Martini vermouth for women — in order to speed up absorption and shorten the detection window. “The athletes were instructed to swish the liquid around in their mouths, under the tongue, to absorb the drugs,” the Times writes. Even with this subterfuge, WADA found that Russia had the highest number of athletes who were caught doping in 2014. Rodchenkov blamed that on athletes who took drugs that he had not approved. — At the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov spearheaded a clandestine, late-night effort to swap out Russian athletes’ dirty urine with clean urine provided months earlier, before the athletes began doping. With the assistance of Russian intelligence officers — who, the Times alleges, were able to develop a replacement for the tamper-proof caps used on the specimen bottles —  Rodchenkov would exchange dirty urine samples with athletes’ clean samples provided by a colleague, who was stationed in what nominally was a storage closet next door. The urine samples were passed back and forth through a hole that had been cut into the wall near the floor. ||| What is the NFL policy? ||| The Baltimore Ravens defense will be without tackle Haloti Ngata for the rest of the regular season after he was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating the performance-enhancing drugs policy. Ngata, in a statement released by the Ravens, said he used Adderall. “I made a mistake, and I own this,” he said. “I took Adderall and take full responsibility for doing this. I am deeply sorry and broken up over this. I let down my family, my teammates Ravens fans and myself. My hope is that the Ravens make the playoffs and I believe they can do this. And then I can come back and help us win.” Adderall, an amphetamine most often prescribed for attention-deficit disorders, is banned by the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NBA, Major League Soccer, the NCAA and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. “This is disappointing news for the Ravens,” Ozzie Newsome, the team’s general manager and executive vice president, said in a statement. “We are disappointed In Haloti, but no more than he is with himself.” Ngata will be eligible to return Dec. ||| Isn’t that speed? ||| Denver Broncos wide receiver has been suspended for four games by the NFL over violations of its performance-enhancing drugs policy, and he’s not at all happy about it. In an e-mail sent to the Denver Post, Welker seemingly takes aim at the league’s drug-testing policy. The league is only saying that Welker tested positive for amphetamine. A source told the Denver Post’s Mike Klis that the amphetamine in question was adderall, not MDMA (aka Molly) as was speculated by some on Tuesday. As Deadspin points out, MDMA is indeed an amphetamine, but it falls under the league’s recreational-drug policy, not its performance-enhancing drug policy, so it’s seemingly not the drug in question here. Last September, the Denver Post wrote about how the NFL deals with adderall, a commonly prescribed drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but one that also causes feelings of exhilaration, increased energy and mental alertness when used in a non-prescribed manner. It is classified as a performance-enhancing drug and a drug of abuse by the NFL.","Utterance: What’s the history of steroid use in sports in the US? ||| Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year.

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (""ca."" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying ""It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?"". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. ||| Why are they banned? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ||| Are there visible signs? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It has also been revealed that many people who administer excessively high doses of anabolic steroids tend to experience mood, sexuality, and aggression changes during or after the use of these drugs, though these effects may be rapid or involve long-term modifications at the genomic level. ||| That sounds easy to spot.  How do they get away with it? ||| Rodchenkov combined three steroids and dissolved that mixture into liquor — Chivas whiskey for men, Martini vermouth for women — in order to speed up absorption and shorten the detection window. “The athletes were instructed to swish the liquid around in their mouths, under the tongue, to absorb the drugs,” the Times writes. Even with this subterfuge, WADA found that Russia had the highest number of athletes who were caught doping in 2014. Rodchenkov blamed that on athletes who took drugs that he had not approved. — At the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov spearheaded a clandestine, late-night effort to swap out Russian athletes’ dirty urine with clean urine provided months earlier, before the athletes began doping. With the assistance of Russian intelligence officers — who, the Times alleges, were able to develop a replacement for the tamper-proof caps used on the specimen bottles —  Rodchenkov would exchange dirty urine samples with athletes’ clean samples provided by a colleague, who was stationed in what nominally was a storage closet next door. The urine samples were passed back and forth through a hole that had been cut into the wall near the floor. ||| What is the NFL policy? ||| The Baltimore Ravens defense will be without tackle Haloti Ngata for the rest of the regular season after he was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating the performance-enhancing drugs policy. Ngata, in a statement released by the Ravens, said he used Adderall. “I made a mistake, and I own this,” he said. “I took Adderall and take full responsibility for doing this. I am deeply sorry and broken up over this. I let down my family, my teammates Ravens fans and myself. My hope is that the Ravens make the playoffs and I believe they can do this. And then I can come back and help us win.” Adderall, an amphetamine most often prescribed for attention-deficit disorders, is banned by the NFL, Major League Baseball, the NBA, Major League Soccer, the NCAA and the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. “This is disappointing news for the Ravens,” Ozzie Newsome, the team’s general manager and executive vice president, said in a statement. “We are disappointed In Haloti, but no more than he is with himself.” Ngata will be eligible to return Dec. ||| Isn’t that speed? ||| Denver Broncos wide receiver has been suspended for four games by the NFL over violations of its performance-enhancing drugs policy, and he’s not at all happy about it. In an e-mail sent to the Denver Post, Welker seemingly takes aim at the league’s drug-testing policy. The league is only saying that Welker tested positive for amphetamine. A source told the Denver Post’s Mike Klis that the amphetamine in question was adderall, not MDMA (aka Molly) as was speculated by some on Tuesday. As Deadspin points out, MDMA is indeed an amphetamine, but it falls under the league’s recreational-drug policy, not its performance-enhancing drug policy, so it’s seemingly not the drug in question here. Last September, the Denver Post wrote about how the NFL deals with adderall, a commonly prescribed drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but one that also causes feelings of exhilaration, increased energy and mental alertness when used in a non-prescribed manner. It is classified as a performance-enhancing drug and a drug of abuse by the NFL. ||| What is the difference between the two policies? ||| Updated with details, Miller statement Von Miller, the Denver Broncos’ linebacker, is facing a four-game suspension from the NFL for violating league policy, according to multiple reports. Miller, defensive rookie of the year in 2011, is presently appealing the discipline, according to ESPN. The Denver Post reports that Miller tested positive for amphetamines and marijuana during his rookie season. Under NFL policy, a positive test for a recreational drug lands a player in a program, and a second triggers a four-game suspension. Testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug results in immediate suspension. Miller issued a denial on Twitter, saying: The NFL Players Association was not pleased that the information leaked out and George Atallah, the NFLPA’s assistant executive director of external affairs, tweeted today: If Miller fails to win on appeal, the Broncos would open the season against the Baltimore Ravens without two of their key defensive players.

With the assistance of Russian intelligence officers — who, the Times alleges, were able to develop a replacement for the tamper-proof caps used on the specimen bottles —  Rodchenkov would exchange dirty urine samples with athletes’ clean samples provided by a colleague, who was stationed in what nominally was a storage closet next door.

In an e-mail sent to the Denver Post, Welker seemingly takes aim at the league’s drug-testing policy. The league is only saying that Welker tested positive for amphetamine. A source told the Denver Post’s Mike Klis that the amphetamine in question was adderall, not MDMA (aka Molly) as was speculated by some on Tuesday. As Deadspin points out, MDMA is indeed an amphetamine, but it falls under the league’s recreational-drug policy, not its performance-enhancing drug policy, so it’s seemingly not the drug in question here. Last September, the Denver Post wrote about how the NFL deals with adderall, a commonly prescribed drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but one that also causes feelings of exhilaration, increased energy and mental alertness when used in a non-prescribed manner.

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (""ca."" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying ""It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?"". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. ||| Why are they banned? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ||| Are there visible signs? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS).

The urine samples were passed back and forth through a hole that had been cut into the wall near the floor. ||| What is the NFL policy? ||| The Baltimore Ravens defense will be without tackle Haloti Ngata for the rest of the regular season after he was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating the performance-enhancing drugs policy. Ngata, in a statement released by the Ravens, said he used Adderall. “I made a mistake, and I own this,” he said. “I took Adderall and take full responsibility for doing this.

And then there are sports (games? pastimes?) that would seem immune to doping because why bother? At the top of that list is bridge, which last we checked is a card game played while seated. But you would be wrong thinking that because the world’s top-ranked bridge player just got himself suspended for doping. As announced Thursday by the World Bridge Federation, Geir Helgemo was suspended for one year after he tested positive for synthetic testosterone and Clomiphene, a fertility drug that accelerates testosterone production in men, after September’s World Bridge Series in Orlando. The WBF said Helgemo — a Norwegian-born player who now competes for Monaco — admitted to doping and accepted his suspension, which ends Nov.","Utterance: What’s the history of steroid use in sports in the US? ||| Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year.

"" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. ||| Why are steroids banned in sports? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. ||| Are there visible signs that someone is using steroids? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It has also been revealed that many people who administer excessively high doses of anabolic steroids tend to experience mood, sexuality, and aggression changes during or after the use of these drugs, though these effects may be rapid or involve long-term modifications at the genomic level. ||| That sounds easy to spot. How do athletes get away with using steroids? ||| Rodchenkov combined three steroids and dissolved that mixture into liquor — Chivas whiskey for men, Martini vermouth for women — in order to speed up absorption and shorten the detection window. “The athletes were instructed to swish the liquid around in their mouths, under the tongue, to absorb the drugs,” the Times writes. ||| What is the NFL policy about steroids? ||| The Baltimore Ravens defense will be without tackle Haloti Ngata for the rest of the regular season after he was suspended for four games by the NFL for violating the performance-enhancing drugs policy. Ngata, in a statement released by the Ravens, said he used Adderall. ||| Is Adderall Speed? ||| Denver Broncos wide receiver has been suspended for four games by the NFL over violations of its performance-enhancing drugs policy, and he’s not at all happy about it. In an e-mail sent to the Denver Post, Welker seemingly takes aim at the league’s drug-testing policy. ||| What is the difference between the NFL’s recreational drug and performance enhancing drug policies? ||| Updated with details, Miller statement Von Miller, the Denver Broncos’ linebacker, is facing a four-game suspension from the NFL for violating league policy, according to multiple reports. Miller, defensive rookie of the year in 2011, is presently appealing the discipline, according to ESPN. ||| I heard it even affects card players.

Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene.

[Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors.","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.

Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases? ||| 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans). Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. ||| You missed the second type of disease.  What was that? ||| A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome . Many chromosome errors cause the fetus to be aborted before birth, but some syndromes can be born and survive, though all typically suffer severe mental and physical defects. Down syndrome is the most common and well-known chromosome defect, but there are many. Types of chromosome diseases: There are several common types of chromosome errors that cause disease. The effects of errors in the sex chromosomes (X and Y) differ greatly from errors in the autosomes (chromosomes 1..22). ||| That’s not what I wanted. How about recent developments in gene therapy to treat those defects? ||| This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. ||| What are they worried about? ||| With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors. ||| No, I meant in humans. ||| That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes. While the ethical and regulatory focus of concern has been on “designer babies” or threats to the human germline, the high risk of unintended consequences also applies to editing the genes of other life forms, from mice and mosquitos to microbes. Some of the top scientists, ethicists and legal experts in the field examine these issues in The WorldPost this week. “Recent leaps in the biosciences, combined with big data analysis, have led us to the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” writes Craig Venter, who led the team that first mapped the human genome and remains on the frontier of new breakthroughs. “Not only have we learned to read and write the genetic code; now we can put it in digital form and translate it back into synthesized life.","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.

Can CRISPR be used to edit RNA?","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA. Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases? ||| 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans). Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. ||| You missed the second type of disease.

Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases? ||| 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans). Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. ||| You missed the second type of disease.  What was that? ||| A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome . Many chromosome errors cause the fetus to be aborted before birth, but some syndromes can be born and survive, though all typically suffer severe mental and physical defects. Down syndrome is the most common and well-known chromosome defect, but there are many. Types of chromosome diseases: There are several common types of chromosome errors that cause disease. The effects of errors in the sex chromosomes (X and Y) differ greatly from errors in the autosomes (chromosomes 1..22). ||| That’s not what I wanted. How about recent developments in gene therapy to treat those defects? ||| This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. ||| What are they worried about? ||| With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors. ||| No, I meant in humans. ||| That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes. While the ethical and regulatory focus of concern has been on “designer babies” or threats to the human germline, the high risk of unintended consequences also applies to editing the genes of other life forms, from mice and mosquitos to microbes. Some of the top scientists, ethicists and legal experts in the field examine these issues in The WorldPost this week. “Recent leaps in the biosciences, combined with big data analysis, have led us to the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” writes Craig Venter, who led the team that first mapped the human genome and remains on the frontier of new breakthroughs. “Not only have we learned to read and write the genetic code; now we can put it in digital form and translate it back into synthesized life. ||| It sounds like it could be used in many places. What other types of organisms has it been tried on? ||| Applications as a Genome-editing and Genome Targeting Tool Following its initial demonstration in 2012 (9), the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely adopted. This has already been successfully used to target important genes in many cell lines and organisms, including human (34), bacteria (41), zebrafish (32), C. elegans (42), plants (34), Xenopus tropicalis (43), yeast (44), Drosophila (45), monkeys (46), rabbits (47), pigs (42), rats (48) and mice (49). Several groups have now taken advantage of this method to introduce single point mutations (deletions or insertions) in a particular target gene, via a single g RNA (14, 21, 29). Using a pair of g RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases instead, it is also possible to induce large deletions or genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations (50). ||| I’ve heard a lot about RNA recently. Can it be used to edit that too? ||| Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA. The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations. ||| What’s the difference between the types you mentioned? ||| What Is CRISPR? And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‘Off’? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system.","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.

There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases? ||| 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans). Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. ||| You missed the second type of disease.  What was that? ||| A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome . Many chromosome errors cause the fetus to be aborted before birth, but some syndromes can be born and survive, though all typically suffer severe mental and physical defects. Down syndrome is the most common and well-known chromosome defect, but there are many. Types of chromosome diseases: There are several common types of chromosome errors that cause disease. The effects of errors in the sex chromosomes (X and Y) differ greatly from errors in the autosomes (chromosomes 1..22). ||| That’s not what I wanted. How about recent developments in gene therapy to treat those defects? ||| This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. ||| What are they worried about? ||| With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors. ||| No, I meant in humans. ||| That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes. While the ethical and regulatory focus of concern has been on “designer babies” or threats to the human germline, the high risk of unintended consequences also applies to editing the genes of other life forms, from mice and mosquitos to microbes. Some of the top scientists, ethicists and legal experts in the field examine these issues in The WorldPost this week. “Recent leaps in the biosciences, combined with big data analysis, have led us to the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” writes Craig Venter, who led the team that first mapped the human genome and remains on the frontier of new breakthroughs. “Not only have we learned to read and write the genetic code; now we can put it in digital form and translate it back into synthesized life. ||| It sounds like it could be used in many places. What other types of organisms has it been tried on? ||| Applications as a Genome-editing and Genome Targeting Tool Following its initial demonstration in 2012 (9), the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely adopted. This has already been successfully used to target important genes in many cell lines and organisms, including human (34), bacteria (41), zebrafish (32), C. elegans (42), plants (34), Xenopus tropicalis (43), yeast (44), Drosophila (45), monkeys (46), rabbits (47), pigs (42), rats (48) and mice (49). Several groups have now taken advantage of this method to introduce single point mutations (deletions or insertions) in a particular target gene, via a single g RNA (14, 21, 29). Using a pair of g RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases instead, it is also possible to induce large deletions or genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations (50). ||| I’ve heard a lot about RNA recently. Can it be used to edit that too? ||| Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA. The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations. ||| What’s the difference between the types you mentioned? ||| What Is CRISPR? And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‘Off’? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system. ||| That’s too basic, I’d like a more scientific explanation. ||| The promise of new CRISPR gene-editing technology has always been that it might lead to a cure for specific genetic diseases. Recently published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene. As Dr. Charis Himeda of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told me in a conversation, this technique is a “non-cutting version of CRISPR” that involves the dCas9 protein rather than the Cas9 protein.","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.

What are the commercial issues using CRISPR for genetic diseases?","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA. Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases? ||| 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans). Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. ||| You missed the second type of disease.  What was that? ||| A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome . Many chromosome errors cause the fetus to be aborted before birth, but some syndromes can be born and survive, though all typically suffer severe mental and physical defects. Down syndrome is the most common and well-known chromosome defect, but there are many. Types of chromosome diseases: There are several common types of chromosome errors that cause disease. The effects of errors in the sex chromosomes (X and Y) differ greatly from errors in the autosomes (chromosomes 1..22). ||| That’s not what I wanted. How about recent developments in gene therapy to treat those defects? ||| This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. ||| What are they worried about? ||| With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors. ||| No, I meant in humans. ||| That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes. While the ethical and regulatory focus of concern has been on “designer babies” or threats to the human germline, the high risk of unintended consequences also applies to editing the genes of other life forms, from mice and mosquitos to microbes. Some of the top scientists, ethicists and legal experts in the field examine these issues in The WorldPost this week. “Recent leaps in the biosciences, combined with big data analysis, have led us to the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” writes Craig Venter, who led the team that first mapped the human genome and remains on the frontier of new breakthroughs. “Not only have we learned to read and write the genetic code; now we can put it in digital form and translate it back into synthesized life. ||| It sounds like it could be used in many places. What other types of organisms has it been tried on? ||| Applications as a Genome-editing and Genome Targeting Tool Following its initial demonstration in 2012 (9), the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely adopted. This has already been successfully used to target important genes in many cell lines and organisms, including human (34), bacteria (41), zebrafish (32), C. elegans (42), plants (34), Xenopus tropicalis (43), yeast (44), Drosophila (45), monkeys (46), rabbits (47), pigs (42), rats (48) and mice (49). Several groups have now taken advantage of this method to introduce single point mutations (deletions or insertions) in a particular target gene, via a single g RNA (14, 21, 29). Using a pair of g RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases instead, it is also possible to induce large deletions or genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations (50). ||| I’ve heard a lot about RNA recently. Can it be used to edit that too? ||| Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA. The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations. ||| What’s the difference between the types you mentioned? ||| What Is CRISPR? And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‘Off’? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system. ||| That’s too basic, I’d like a more scientific explanation. ||| The promise of new CRISPR gene-editing technology has always been that it might lead to a cure for specific genetic diseases. Recently published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene. As Dr. Charis Himeda of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told me in a conversation, this technique is a “non-cutting version of CRISPR” that involves the dCas9 protein rather than the Cas9 protein. ||| The developments sound exciting. What are the commercial issues using it? ||| Section::::Applications.:""In vitro"" genetic depletion. Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant off-target effects as seen with restriction enzymes. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries. Section::::Patents and commercialization. , SAGE Labs (part of Horizon Discovery group) had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and non-exclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models. , Thermo Fisher Scientific had licensed intellectual property from ToolGen to develop CRISPR reagent kits. , patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools. As companies ramp up financing, doubts as to whether CRISPR can be quickly monetized were raised. In February 2017 the US Patent Office ruled on a patent interference case brought by University of California with respect to patents issued to the Broad Institute, and found that the Broad patents, with claims covering the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, were distinct from the inventions claimed by University of California.","How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA.

Ferritin, a protein, serves as a storage form of iron that when low indicates iron deficiency. Your physician interprets your ferritin test results and recommends improving your ferritin levels when tests indicate they are low. With some know-how and dietary changes, you can improve your iron intake so that your ferritin levels increase.1Consume a wide variety of iron-rich foods. Following a restrictive diet that omits many foods increases your risk of having low ferritin. There are two forms of iron – animal foods contain heme iron, while plants contain non-heme iron. Eat plenty of vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains and fortified foods for non-heme iron. You can find heme iron in eggs, meat, fish, poultry and seafood.","I’m a runner and I’ve been feeling tired. My doctor said my ferritin count is slightly low.

Ferritin, a protein, serves as a storage form of iron that when low indicates iron deficiency. Your physician interprets your ferritin test results and recommends improving your ferritin levels when tests indicate they are low. With some know-how and dietary changes, you can improve your iron intake so that your ferritin levels increase.1Consume a wide variety of iron-rich foods. Following a restrictive diet that omits many foods increases your risk of having low ferritin. There are two forms of iron – animal foods contain heme iron, while plants contain non-heme iron. Eat plenty of vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains and fortified foods for non-heme iron. You can find heme iron in eggs, meat, fish, poultry and seafood. ||| What is the difference between the two types? ||| Certain chemicals like polyphenols which are found in tea, coffee, other beverages, and many plants, limit the absorption of non-heme iron.

Normally, 60% of non-heme iron is present in animal products. The remaining 40% is heme iron.• Dietary non-heme iron is present as ferric iron (Fe III), and it has to be reduced to ferrous iron (Fe II) in order to be absorbed.• Unlike non-heme iron, heme iron is associated with hemoglobin and myoglobin in the form of ferrous (Fe II) iron. ||| I’m vegetarian.

Old advice to limit eggs to just a few each week has also been abandoned. According to the Food Standards Agency, there’s now no limit to the number of eggs you can eat in a week as part of a healthy balanced diet. ||| I’m also a woman over 50. How many do I need to eat to get the recommended amount? ||| You’ll get over 3.5 grams of protein from the white of a large egg. Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts. You’ll get some of the bone-building minerals -- calcium, magnesium and phosphorus -- as well as the electrolyte minerals potassium and sodium. Electrolytes conduct electricity for muscle and heart functions. This lean protein source even has a bit of iron, a mineral you need for blood processes, as well as antioxidant minerals zinc and selenium.","I’m a runner and I’ve been feeling tired.

Ferritin, a protein, serves as a storage form of iron that when low indicates iron deficiency. Your physician interprets your ferritin test results and recommends improving your ferritin levels when tests indicate they are low. With some know-how and dietary changes, you can improve your iron intake so that your ferritin levels increase.1Consume a wide variety of iron-rich foods. Following a restrictive diet that omits many foods increases your risk of having low ferritin. There are two forms of iron – animal foods contain heme iron, while plants contain non-heme iron. Eat plenty of vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains and fortified foods for non-heme iron. You can find heme iron in eggs, meat, fish, poultry and seafood. ||| What is the difference between the two types? ||| Certain chemicals like polyphenols which are found in tea, coffee, other beverages, and many plants, limit the absorption of non-heme iron. What is the differences between heme iron and nonheme iron?• Heme iron is much more bioavailable than non-heme iron so that heme iron is better absorbed than non heme iron.• Heme iron is found only in animal foods while non-heme iron is found in both animal and plant foods.• Plant foods contain only non-heme iron. Heme irons are absent in the plant foods.• Foods rich in heme-iron can improve the absorption of non-heme iron.• The most abundant dietary iron is non-heme iron. Normally, 60% of non-heme iron is present in animal products. The remaining 40% is heme iron.• Dietary non-heme iron is present as ferric iron (Fe III), and it has to be reduced to ferrous iron (Fe II) in order to be absorbed.• Unlike non-heme iron, heme iron is associated with hemoglobin and myoglobin in the form of ferrous (Fe II) iron. ||| I’m vegetarian. So, what can I do to improve it and increase my levels? ||| What have you done to increase your ferritin levels? Any supplements, diets, that work? I am trying to find out as much as I can. Per my doctor’s instructions, I started taking liquid B12 along with methyl folate which is supposed to help with the vitamin B12 absorption (although my B12 isn’t really low).

Enter your details to calculate your ideal weight range, and discover how soon you could reach it!Imperial Metric Height ft in Weight st lb Weight Loss Resources says…This study suggests that eating eggs for breakfast makes you feel fuller for longer so that you eat less at your next few meals. This is great news if you’re trying to lose weight as it means you may find it easier to cut calories without feeling hungry. In fact, based on these results you could expect to lose up to 2lb a month, simply by eating eggs for breakfast!Eggs are packed with a variety of nutrients including protein, zinc, iron and vitamins A, D, E and B12, but contain just 85 calories each. Old advice to limit eggs to just a few each week has also been abandoned. According to the Food Standards Agency, there’s now no limit to the number of eggs you can eat in a week as part of a healthy balanced diet. ||| I’m also a woman over 50. How many do I need to eat to get the recommended amount? ||| You’ll get over 3.5 grams of protein from the white of a large egg. Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts. You’ll get some of the bone-building minerals -- calcium, magnesium and phosphorus -- as well as the electrolyte minerals potassium and sodium. Electrolytes conduct electricity for muscle and heart functions. This lean protein source even has a bit of iron, a mineral you need for blood processes, as well as antioxidant minerals zinc and selenium. ||| I’m starting to train for a marathon, what should I consider? ||| Poor health plagued Rich Roll before he adopted a plant-based diet and began a career as a world-class ultramarathoner in his 40s. And tennis star Venus Williams famously chose a raw vegan regimen five years ago after being diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome, an immune-system disorder that caused her joint pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. Along with these stories comes a common query from incredulous non-vegans: “How do you get enough protein?” “It’s always the first question,” says Torre Washington, a bodybuilder who has been following a vegan diet for 18 years, laughing. “But you really don’t need protein to get shredded and lean. I’m looking for nutrients and focused on variety.” Indeed, vegan athletes including Washington and 10-time Olympic medalist Carl Lewis — who retired from athletic competition in 1997 and has said that athletes have “the worst diets in the world and compete in spite of it” — tend to agree that athletes should put an emphasis on increased calories when in training, as opposed to more protein.","I’m a runner and I’ve been feeling tired.

(13)Finally, presenting mental health care services in culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to increasing access to and usage of mental health care services, as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical perspective on mental illness. For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes toward mental illness surveyed students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The Indian students were more likely to view depression as arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation” as ways to deal with depression. ||| What are the causes of stigma in Africa? ||| The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward. Section::::Perspectives. The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others. ||| Could you expand on some of these methods? ||| The unique infrageneric diversity of ""Aloe L."" (""Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae"") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. ""Cannabis sativa"" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. ""Carduus tenuiflorus"" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. ""Datura stramonium"" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. ||| How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? ||| African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that ""traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures"". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. ||| Okay. Now, what about the causes in Asia? ||| Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies.

In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do.","How are mental health disorders perceived and addressed around the world? ||| The survey data, which included responses from 16 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific, showed that 22.1% of participants from developing countries and 11.7% of participants from developed countries experienced embarrassment and discrimination due to their mental illness.

(13)Finally, presenting mental health care services in culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to increasing access to and usage of mental health care services, as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical perspective on mental illness. For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes toward mental illness surveyed students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The Indian students were more likely to view depression as arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation” as ways to deal with depression. ||| What are the causes of stigma in Africa? ||| The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward. Section::::Perspectives. The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others. ||| Could you expand on some of these methods? ||| The unique infrageneric diversity of ""Aloe L."" (""Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae"") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. ""Cannabis sativa"" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. ""Carduus tenuiflorus"" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. ""Datura stramonium"" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. ||| How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? ||| African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that ""traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures"". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. ||| Okay. Now, what about the causes in Asia? ||| Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies. A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. ||| Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? ||| Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married. In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. ||| Wow. Besides these values, what other factors could cause stigmatization? ||| (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic study of 25 severely mentally ill individuals living in inner city Hartford, Connecticut.","How are mental health disorders perceived and addressed around the world? ||| The survey data, which included responses from 16 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific, showed that 22.1% of participants from developing countries and 11.7% of participants from developed countries experienced embarrassment and discrimination due to their mental illness.

It spreads unjustified fears about the mentally ill and worsens the stigma around it."" The 2018 FBI study found that shooters typically experienced several stressors in the year before they attack: financial pressures, fights with classmates or co-workers, and substance abuse. And on average, shooters displayed four to five concerning behaviors that those around them could notice — the most frequent being behavior related to mental health, interpersonal conflicts or some sign of violent intent.

However, the authors note that these figures likely underestimate the extent of stigma associated with mental illness since they only evaluated data on anxiety and mood disorders. (13)Finally, presenting mental health care services in culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to increasing access to and usage of mental health care services, as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical perspective on mental illness. For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes toward mental illness surveyed students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The Indian students were more likely to view depression as arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation” as ways to deal with depression. ||| What are the causes of stigma in Africa? ||| The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward. Section::::Perspectives. The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others. ||| Could you expand on some of these methods? ||| The unique infrageneric diversity of ""Aloe L."" (""Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae"") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. ""Cannabis sativa"" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. ""Carduus tenuiflorus"" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. ""Datura stramonium"" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. ||| How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? ||| African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that ""traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures"". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. ||| Okay. Now, what about the causes in Asia? ||| Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies. A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. ||| Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? ||| Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married. In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. ||| Wow. Besides these values, what other factors could cause stigmatization? ||| (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic study of 25 severely mentally ill individuals living in inner city Hartford, Connecticut. ||| What about the causes in North America? ||| In an interview last year, Resnick said, “you have to remember, people kill for all sorts of reasons. They kill for profit or love or greed.” Mental health advocates say comments such as Trump’s labeling shooters as “mentally ill monsters” can exacerbate false stereotypes about the mentally ill. “When you blame people with mental illness for things like mass shootings, it’s not just untrue,” said Angela Kimball, head of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “It keeps people from seeking help even when they need it. It spreads unjustified fears about the mentally ill and worsens the stigma around it."" The 2018 FBI study found that shooters typically experienced several stressors in the year before they attack: financial pressures, fights with classmates or co-workers, and substance abuse. And on average, shooters displayed four to five concerning behaviors that those around them could notice — the most frequent being behavior related to mental health, interpersonal conflicts or some sign of violent intent. Researchers point out that other countries have similar rates of mental illness but a small fraction of America’s gun deaths. ||| Hmm. What has the Alliance done to help? ||| The Post painted a heartbreaking picture of the helplessness felt by caregivers of people with mental illness [“Behind the yellow door,” June 29]. In our well-meant efforts to protect people outside the mainstream from abuse, we have lost the ability to provide needed help to those unable to seek it for themselves. Family members must watch a loved one slip deeper into the chaos of a disordered mind, ever fearful that the event that crosses a boundary and requires treatment may also be a tragedy. The National Alliance for Mental Illness provides a free 12-week course for family members. These classes, named Family to Family, are taught by volunteers who have lived through similar frustrations and fears. The course explains the physical nature of mental illness, describes current medications and treatments, and provides practical techniques for effective communication between caregivers and people with mental illness.

However, the authors note that these figures likely underestimate the extent of stigma associated with mental illness since they only evaluated data on anxiety and mood disorders. (13)Finally, presenting mental health care services in culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to increasing access to and usage of mental health care services, as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical perspective on mental illness. For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes toward mental illness surveyed students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The Indian students were more likely to view depression as arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation” as ways to deal with depression. ||| What are the causes of stigma in Africa? ||| The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward. Section::::Perspectives. The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others. ||| Could you expand on some of these methods? ||| The unique infrageneric diversity of ""Aloe L."" (""Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae"") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. ""Cannabis sativa"" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. ""Carduus tenuiflorus"" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. ""Datura stramonium"" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. ||| How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? ||| African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that ""traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures"". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. ||| Okay. Now, what about the causes in Asia? ||| Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies. A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. ||| Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? ||| Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married. In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. ||| Wow. Besides these values, what other factors could cause stigmatization? ||| (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic study of 25 severely mentally ill individuals living in inner city Hartford, Connecticut. ||| What about the causes in North America? ||| In an interview last year, Resnick said, “you have to remember, people kill for all sorts of reasons. They kill for profit or love or greed.” Mental health advocates say comments such as Trump’s labeling shooters as “mentally ill monsters” can exacerbate false stereotypes about the mentally ill. “When you blame people with mental illness for things like mass shootings, it’s not just untrue,” said Angela Kimball, head of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “It keeps people from seeking help even when they need it. It spreads unjustified fears about the mentally ill and worsens the stigma around it."" The 2018 FBI study found that shooters typically experienced several stressors in the year before they attack: financial pressures, fights with classmates or co-workers, and substance abuse. And on average, shooters displayed four to five concerning behaviors that those around them could notice — the most frequent being behavior related to mental health, interpersonal conflicts or some sign of violent intent. Researchers point out that other countries have similar rates of mental illness but a small fraction of America’s gun deaths. ||| Hmm. What has the Alliance done to help? ||| The Post painted a heartbreaking picture of the helplessness felt by caregivers of people with mental illness [“Behind the yellow door,” June 29]. In our well-meant efforts to protect people outside the mainstream from abuse, we have lost the ability to provide needed help to those unable to seek it for themselves. Family members must watch a loved one slip deeper into the chaos of a disordered mind, ever fearful that the event that crosses a boundary and requires treatment may also be a tragedy. The National Alliance for Mental Illness provides a free 12-week course for family members. These classes, named Family to Family, are taught by volunteers who have lived through similar frustrations and fears. The course explains the physical nature of mental illness, describes current medications and treatments, and provides practical techniques for effective communication between caregivers and people with mental illness. Bob Wirtz, Baltimore ||| I found the Indian student's approach to treating depression interesting.

So, how to get help to all the people who needed it when there were few financial, technical or material resources? And how to convince people to reach out when their culture made them reluctant to admit their emotional pain for fear of seeming weak or even possessed? To address both, Chibanda stripped mental health care down to basic human connection. He removed the medical and technical elements that made seeking treatment intimidating, and developed a simple solution to enlist the help of lay health workers who could take on matriarchal roles. He first called the meeting spots “mental health benches,” but that was too stigmatizing, so he gave them a more inviting name: “Friendship Benches.” The grandmothers are trained in what is essentially the Western model of cognitive behavioral therapy, but they use indigenous terms that their “patients” can more easily relate to. There’s not even a word for depression in Zimbabwe, that’s too clinical.","How are mental health disorders perceived and addressed around the world? ||| The survey data, which included responses from 16 countries in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific, showed that 22.1% of participants from developing countries and 11.7% of participants from developed countries experienced embarrassment and discrimination due to their mental illness.

How are devices used in Islamic ones? ||| Islamic poetry Islamic poetry is poetry written by Muslims. Islamic poetry has been written in many languages. Section::::History and origins. Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the “Age of Ignorance”. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran.

Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the ""Magnificat"" and ""Nunc Dimittis"", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models.

Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the “Age of Ignorance”. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran.

How does the use of rhyme in Biblical poetry compare? ||| The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call- and-response performance.","How are literary devices used in Biblical poetry? ||| A fuller appreciation of the formal literary virtues of Biblical poetry remained unavailable for European Christians until 1754, when Robert Lowth (later made a bishop in the Church of England), kinder to the Hebrew language than his own, published ""Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum"", which identified parallelism as the chief rhetorical device within Hebrew poetry.

Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was ""parallelism"", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.","How are literary devices used in Biblical poetry? ||| A fuller appreciation of the formal literary virtues of Biblical poetry remained unavailable for European Christians until 1754, when Robert Lowth (later made a bishop in the Church of England), kinder to the Hebrew language than his own, published ""Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum"", which identified parallelism as the chief rhetorical device within Hebrew poetry.

In many European vernacular literatures, Christian poetry appears among the earliest monuments of those literatures, and Biblical paraphrases in verse often precede Bible translations. In Old English poetry, the ""Dream of the Rood"", a meditation on Christ's crucifixion which adapts Germanic heroic imagery and applies it to Jesus, is one of the earliest extant monuments of Old English literature. Dante Alighieri's ""The Divine Comedy"" represents one of the earliest monuments of Italian vernacular literature. Much Old Irish poetry was the work of Irish monks and is on religious themes. This story is repeated in most European languages. Modern Christian poetry especially suffers from a difficulty of definition. The writings of a Christian poet are not necessarily classified as Christian poetry. ||| That's interesting. How is it defined? ||| Christian poetry Christian poetry is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide allegory. Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the ""Magnificat"" and ""Nunc Dimittis"", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models. Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles. Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 (following) are thought by many Biblical scholars to represent early Christian hymns that were being quoted by the Apostle: Within the world of classical antiquity, Christian poets often struggled with their relationship to the existing traditions of Greek and Latin poetry, which were of course heavily influenced by paganism. ||| How did those traditions affect them? ||| Paul quotes the pagan poets Aratus and Epimenides in Acts 17:28: ""For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as certain also of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'"" Some early Christian poets such as Ausonius continued to include allusions to pagan deities and standard classical figures and allusions continued to appear in his verse. Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the ""Psychomachia"" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms. Other early Christian poets were more innovative. The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the ""Vexilla Regis"" (""The Royal Standard"") and ""Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis"" (""Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle""). From a literary and linguistic viewpoint, these hymns represent important innovations; they turn away from Greek prosody and instead seem to have been based on the rhythmic marching songs of Roman armies. ||| That's interesting about Christianity. How are devices used in Islamic ones? ||| Islamic poetry Islamic poetry is poetry written by Muslims. Islamic poetry has been written in many languages. Section::::History and origins. Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the “Age of Ignorance”. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran. Islamic poetry is very important and it is a heritage passed from generation to generation. These poems and features examine Muslim faith and Islamic culture and address important events, holidays, and occasions such as Ramadan. These poets explore a range of spiritual, literary, and political concerns from the 6th century to the present day. Also, Islamic poetry was found centuries ago. ||| Okay. How does the use of rhyme in Biblical poetry compare? ||| The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call- and-response performance. ||| Why didn't it use rhymes as much? ||| Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages. Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was ""parallelism"", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. ||| Ahh, it seems like rhyming and parallelism share similar functions. How did both types of poetry influence other kinds of poetry? ||| Rhymed prose Rhymed prose is a literary form and literary genre, written in unmetrical rhymes. This form has been known in many different cultures. In some cases the rhymed prose is a distinctive, well-defined style of writing. In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry. Section::::Arabic culture and influences. In classic Arabic literature the rhymed prose is called ""saj'"". An elaborate Arabic kind of rhymed prose is ""maqama"". It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's ""Gulestan"") and Turkish (). ""Maqama"" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world. It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer. The corresponding works were called ""maqamat"" or ""mahbarot"" (""mahberot"", e.g., ""Mahbarot Emmanuel"", by Immanuel the Roman).","How are literary devices used in Biblical poetry? ||| A fuller appreciation of the formal literary virtues of Biblical poetry remained unavailable for European Christians until 1754, when Robert Lowth (later made a bishop in the Church of England), kinder to the Hebrew language than his own, published ""Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum"", which identified parallelism as the chief rhetorical device within Hebrew poetry.

Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality. Amnesty International documented at least 82 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, extortion and rape by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest.

SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter. Temi Afolabi, a lawyer in Lagos, said officers have a reputation for searching phones at random and detaining people for outrageous reasons.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

What happened? ||| People in the world’s largest Black nation have taken to the streets to demand one thing of their police: Stop killing us. Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality. Amnesty International documented at least 82 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, extortion and rape by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020. ||| Why was the Squad established in the first place? ||| Now he doesn’t drive after dark. On that October night last year, he said, the officers drained his bank account. His lawyer called the police station. Nothing happened. “You kind of give up on these things,” Olaitan said. SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter. Temi Afolabi, a lawyer in Lagos, said officers have a reputation for searching phones at random and detaining people for outrageous reasons. ||| What's an example of those reasons? ||| The officers, who often worked in plain clothes, developed a reputation for stopping young people, accusing them of theft and then stealing their money, activists say. The Nigerian Police Force said it has fired at least two officers since the demonstrations began and has said it would probe past atrocities with the help of civil society leaders. Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people. ||| How did the international community respond? ||| One month after the kidnapping of more than 300 students in Chibok, Nigeria, international teams from the U.S., U.K., China, France  and Israel have arrived in Nigeria to assist local authorities in the hunt for the 276 girls who are still missing. International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts. ||| Okay, but I meant their response to the EndSars protests. ||| What started as a grass-roots movement to end police brutality in Africa’s most populous country has become a global phenomenon embraced by the world’s biggest celebrities: #EndSARS. In the two weeks since Nigerians began flooding the streets to rally against a police unit widely viewed as abusive, overseas megastars such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Cardi B and Drake have thrown their fame behind the cause. Now the protest is dominating social media feeds on practically every continent and, by Wednesday, had made its way into the U.S. presidential race. “The United States must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in a statement. Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

What was their role?","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020. What happened? ||| People in the world’s largest Black nation have taken to the streets to demand one thing of their police: Stop killing us. Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality. Amnesty International documented at least 82 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, extortion and rape by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020. ||| Why was the Squad established in the first place? ||| Now he doesn’t drive after dark. On that October night last year, he said, the officers drained his bank account. His lawyer called the police station. Nothing happened. “You kind of give up on these things,” Olaitan said. SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter. Temi Afolabi, a lawyer in Lagos, said officers have a reputation for searching phones at random and detaining people for outrageous reasons. ||| What's an example of those reasons? ||| The officers, who often worked in plain clothes, developed a reputation for stopping young people, accusing them of theft and then stealing their money, activists say. The Nigerian Police Force said it has fired at least two officers since the demonstrations began and has said it would probe past atrocities with the help of civil society leaders. Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people. ||| How did the international community respond? ||| One month after the kidnapping of more than 300 students in Chibok, Nigeria, international teams from the U.S., U.K., China, France  and Israel have arrived in Nigeria to assist local authorities in the hunt for the 276 girls who are still missing. International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts. ||| Okay, but I meant their response to the EndSars protests. ||| What started as a grass-roots movement to end police brutality in Africa’s most populous country has become a global phenomenon embraced by the world’s biggest celebrities: #EndSARS. In the two weeks since Nigerians began flooding the streets to rally against a police unit widely viewed as abusive, overseas megastars such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Cardi B and Drake have thrown their fame behind the cause. Now the protest is dominating social media feeds on practically every continent and, by Wednesday, had made its way into the U.S. presidential race. “The United States must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in a statement. Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. ||| Did that help? ||| As Human Rights Watch’s Sarah Margon notes, any action to assist the Nigerian army is fraught with moral hazard; this is an army that is responsible for almost as many abuses against civilians in northeastern Nigeria as Boko Haram itself. There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. ||| My friend also mentioned that women were instrumental to the movement. What was their role? ||| Nigeria’s #EndSARS movement has spawned over 150 mass protests in cities across the country, with demonstrations intensifying after soldiers reportedly fired live rounds into protesters at the Lekki toll plaza in Lagos on Oct. 20. The movement has also inspired solidarity protests in major cities of the world, including London, New York, Berlin and Washington. Women play a leading role in the ongoing #EndSARS movement against police brutality and government violence in Nigeria, specifically seeking to abolish a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. One nascent women’s group in particular, the Feminist Coalition, has used digital platforms to mobilize funds and design strategies to support protesters across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition’s work in the #EndSARS movement continues a long history of women leading and supporting political mobilizations across Africa. This engagement, however, has typically been minimized or ignored outright in the retelling of the events. Here’s what you need to know. Who are the Feminist Coalition? In July, Damilola Odufuwa and Odunayo Eweniyi, both under 30, formed the Feminist Coalition activist group alongside 12 other young women.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people. ||| How did the international community respond? ||| One month after the kidnapping of more than 300 students in Chibok, Nigeria, international teams from the U.S., U.K., China, France  and Israel have arrived in Nigeria to assist local authorities in the hunt for the 276 girls who are still missing. International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts. ||| Okay, but I meant their response to the EndSars protests. ||| What started as a grass-roots movement to end police brutality in Africa’s most populous country has become a global phenomenon embraced by the world’s biggest celebrities: #EndSARS. In the two weeks since Nigerians began flooding the streets to rally against a police unit widely viewed as abusive, overseas megastars such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Cardi B and Drake have thrown their fame behind the cause. Now the protest is dominating social media feeds on practically every continent and, by Wednesday, had made its way into the U.S. presidential race. “The United States must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in a statement. Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. ||| Did that help? ||| As Human Rights Watch’s Sarah Margon notes, any action to assist the Nigerian army is fraught with moral hazard; this is an army that is responsible for almost as many abuses against civilians in northeastern Nigeria as Boko Haram itself. There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. ||| My friend also mentioned that women were instrumental to the movement. What was their role? ||| Nigeria’s #EndSARS movement has spawned over 150 mass protests in cities across the country, with demonstrations intensifying after soldiers reportedly fired live rounds into protesters at the Lekki toll plaza in Lagos on Oct. 20.

Women play a leading role in the ongoing #EndSARS movement against police brutality and government violence in Nigeria, specifically seeking to abolish a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. One nascent women’s group in particular, the Feminist Coalition, has used digital platforms to mobilize funds and design strategies to support protesters across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition’s work in the #EndSARS movement continues a long history of women leading and supporting political mobilizations across Africa.

What happened? ||| People in the world’s largest Black nation have taken to the streets to demand one thing of their police: Stop killing us. Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality. Amnesty International documented at least 82 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, extortion and rape by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020. ||| Why was the Squad established in the first place? ||| Now he doesn’t drive after dark. On that October night last year, he said, the officers drained his bank account. His lawyer called the police station. Nothing happened. “You kind of give up on these things,” Olaitan said. SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter.

My book, “Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,” examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives. I studied archival materials of the battle by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923. My research showed how the NAACP raised public awareness, met with American presidents, secured the support of Members of Congress, and won a consequential criminal justice victory in the Supreme Court. Drawing from the book’s findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why protesters believe recent police misconduct is emblematic of a system of racial injustice and not just a few bad apples. For many blacks, what is happening right now is not new; it is grounded in a documented history of state violence against black citizens.","A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020.

Monthly salaries for fashion designers vary widely, based on employer, experience, location and talent. Fashion designers search for inspiration to sketch, cut and sew fabrics into the next big trend in clothing.

According to the Fashion Designer Salary Data website, the average salary range for most fashion designers is between $50,000 and $80,000 a year, which equates to $4,167 and $6,667 a month. Most fashion designers earn about $65,000 annually, or $5,417 per month. Some designers earn considerably more, especially those who own their own successful fashion design company and design clothes for wealthy people and celebrities. They can easily make a few million dollars each year, or hundreds of thousands a month. ||| How can I get a degree in it? ||| The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that a bachelor's degree related to fashion design is usually needed to gain an entry-level position in the industry ( www.bls.gov ). A common type of degree is the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), which may have a major in fashion or fashion design. You might also get to pursue a specialization, such as knitwear, intimate apparel, visual merchandising, textiles, special occasion wear or children's wear. BFA Program Requirements A BFA program in fashion or fashion design provides you with opportunities to study in-depth topics through electives or core curriculum, and studio courses give you hands-on experience. In addition to studying fashion, you might also take courses in business or merchandising. Although your chosen specialization can affect your program's curriculum requirements, common topics of study include the following:2-D and 3-D fashion design Fashion drawing Sewing techniques Art and fashion history Fashion color Textiles Fashion draping Before you graduate, you will usually create a portfolio and complete an internship. ||| Okay. What does the portfolio usually consist of? ||| A typical type of a portfolio is one used by artists. An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. Art Portfolios, sometimes called ""artfolios"", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs. For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture. Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as ""demo tapes"", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works.","I like fashion and animals.

Some designers earn considerably more, especially those who own their own successful fashion design company and design clothes for wealthy people and celebrities. They can easily make a few million dollars each year, or hundreds of thousands a month. ||| How can I get a degree in it? ||| The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that a bachelor's degree related to fashion design is usually needed to gain an entry-level position in the industry ( www.bls.gov ). A common type of degree is the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), which may have a major in fashion or fashion design. You might also get to pursue a specialization, such as knitwear, intimate apparel, visual merchandising, textiles, special occasion wear or children's wear. BFA Program Requirements A BFA program in fashion or fashion design provides you with opportunities to study in-depth topics through electives or core curriculum, and studio courses give you hands-on experience. In addition to studying fashion, you might also take courses in business or merchandising. Although your chosen specialization can affect your program's curriculum requirements, common topics of study include the following:2-D and 3-D fashion design Fashion drawing Sewing techniques Art and fashion history Fashion color Textiles Fashion draping Before you graduate, you will usually create a portfolio and complete an internship. ||| Okay. What does the portfolio usually consist of? ||| A typical type of a portfolio is one used by artists. An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. Art Portfolios, sometimes called ""artfolios"", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs. For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture. Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as ""demo tapes"", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works. ||| What are the common entry requirements for the degree? ||| Education &amp; Training Required Fashion designers typically need an associate or a bachelor's degree in fashion design. Some fashion designers also combine a fashion design degree with a business, marketing, or fashion merchandising degree, especially those who want to run their own business or retail store. Basic coursework includes color, textiles, sewing and tailoring, pattern making, fashion history, computer-aided design (CAD), and design of different types of clothing such as menswear or footwear. Coursework in human anatomy, mathematics, and psychology also is useful. The National Association of Schools of Art and Design accredits approximately 300 postsecondary institutions with programs in art and design. Most of these schools award degrees in fashion design. Many schools do not allow formal entry into a program until a student has successfully completed basic art and design courses. Applicants usually have to submit sketches and other examples of their artistic ability. Aspiring fashion designers can learn these necessary skills through internships with design or manufacturing firms. Some designers also gain valuable experience working in retail stores, as personal stylists, or as custom tailors. ||| I’ll consider those. How about my options for my other interest? ||| Teen Vogue indicates that aspiring fashion magazine journalists may want to study English or journalism, while those working with fashion photography may pursue design-related degrees.

If you pursue a degree in general journalism, one or several fashion writing classes are likely available to you. Some schools may also offer special seminars, clubs or other activities for journalism students interested in fashion. Fashion journalism courses or concentrations teach you about relevant general and journalism-specific concepts, such as visual merchandising, textiles, fashion marketing, event reporting, trend analysis and designer collection reviews. You also study basic journalism topics like news reporting, mass media and society magazine writing, opinion commentary, copyediting, promotional writing and media law.","I like fashion and animals.

Art Portfolios, sometimes called ""artfolios"", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs. For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture. Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as ""demo tapes"", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works. ||| What are the common entry requirements for the degree? ||| Education &amp; Training Required Fashion designers typically need an associate or a bachelor's degree in fashion design.

Basic coursework includes color, textiles, sewing and tailoring, pattern making, fashion history, computer-aided design (CAD), and design of different types of clothing such as menswear or footwear. Coursework in human anatomy, mathematics, and psychology also is useful. The National Association of Schools of Art and Design accredits approximately 300 postsecondary institutions with programs in art and design. Most of these schools award degrees in fashion design. Many schools do not allow formal entry into a program until a student has successfully completed basic art and design courses.

D. V. M. candidates must pass an examination on state laws and regulations governing the field of veterinary medicine. Most states require veterinarians to participate in continuing education dealing with newly discovered diseases and newly developed treatments in order to renew a vet's license on a regular basis.

What could it be? ||| Home Swollen Ear Ear Care: Swollen Dog Ear Quick Links Overview Problems Infections Scratching Itching Swelling Treatment Reader &amp; Vet Q&amp;ACauses: The most common and famous reason amongst researchers for dog swollen ear is inflammation. Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem.","My dog has been shaking and tilting its head a lot recently.

Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

What could be wrong? ||| This was cause for concern and we were going to check his ears when we got home. He kept shaking and shaking ... and then we saw an ant waltz out of his ear. There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully. Pay particularly close attention to the ears. Some culprits are obvious and easy to deal with. Some require attention of your veterinarian. A common cause of head shaking is otitis, inflammation of the ear canal. ||| I just checked and there’s swelling in the outer portion. What could it be? ||| Home Swollen Ear Ear Care: Swollen Dog Ear Quick Links Overview Problems Infections Scratching Itching Swelling Treatment Reader &amp; Vet Q&amp;ACauses: The most common and famous reason amongst researchers for dog swollen ear is inflammation. Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. ||| How dangerous could these be? ||| Each hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

David Nichols, DVM SK'84. ||| I live in a remote area. How can I treat it at home? ||| Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic).","My dog has been shaking and tilting its head a lot recently.

Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty’s ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store. Add several drops to the kitty’s ears once daily for 21 days. The oils have a healing effect so if your kitty has inflamed or painful ears, this will help. These are the best remedies for cats with ear mites and now you can choose the conventional or the holistic approach. Your cat will feel much better and she will love you for it.","My dog has been shaking and tilting its head a lot recently.

Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. ||| How dangerous could these be? ||| Each hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it. Good luck to you and your pooch.23.9k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Aubrey Brennan Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date? David Nichols, DVM SK'84. ||| I live in a remote area. How can I treat it at home? ||| Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). ||| My cat is also having similar symptoms. Would that work for her as well? ||| WARNING: Do not use this method if the ears are red and swollen or have any open wounds. Garlic and Olive Oil combined are great for treating ear mites. Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty’s ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store. Add several drops to the kitty’s ears once daily for 21 days. The oils have a healing effect so if your kitty has inflamed or painful ears, this will help. These are the best remedies for cats with ear mites and now you can choose the conventional or the holistic approach. Your cat will feel much better and she will love you for it. ||| Thanks.

While there have been some dogs affected by coronaviruses, this coronavirus (which causes the disease covid-19) is not thought to be a threat to dogs or cats. There’s no evidence that domestic pets play “a significant role in spreading the virus,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people. No special precautions need to be taken with the dog; just practice normal hygiene. Check with your veterinarian for more information.

What could be wrong? ||| This was cause for concern and we were going to check his ears when we got home. He kept shaking and shaking ... and then we saw an ant waltz out of his ear. There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully. Pay particularly close attention to the ears. Some culprits are obvious and easy to deal with. Some require attention of your veterinarian. A common cause of head shaking is otitis, inflammation of the ear canal. ||| I just checked and there’s swelling in the outer portion.

The case has raised the specter that dogs might be swept into the epidemic, which, even now, public health officials say does not appear to infect or be spread by pets. But experts say much remains unknown about the dog’s infection, and they emphasized the lone case is not yet cause for alarm or reassessments about interactions with pets. The dog is owned by a person who was hospitalized with covid-19, and it has been quarantined since Feb. 26, according to Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. The department said last week that the dog’s “weak positive” test results, from nasal and oral swabs, might have been the result of “environmental contamination,” not infection. But positive tests since then suggest the dog does have a low-level of infection, the department said Wednesday.","My dog has been shaking and tilting its head a lot recently.

What could be wrong? ||| This was cause for concern and we were going to check his ears when we got home. He kept shaking and shaking ... and then we saw an ant waltz out of his ear. There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully. Pay particularly close attention to the ears. Some culprits are obvious and easy to deal with. Some require attention of your veterinarian. A common cause of head shaking is otitis, inflammation of the ear canal. ||| I just checked and there’s swelling in the outer portion. What could it be? ||| Home Swollen Ear Ear Care: Swollen Dog Ear Quick Links Overview Problems Infections Scratching Itching Swelling Treatment Reader &amp; Vet Q&amp;ACauses: The most common and famous reason amongst researchers for dog swollen ear is inflammation. Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. ||| How dangerous could these be? ||| Each hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it. Good luck to you and your pooch.23.9k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Aubrey Brennan Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date? David Nichols, DVM SK'84. ||| I live in a remote area. How can I treat it at home? ||| Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). ||| My cat is also having similar symptoms. Would that work for her as well? ||| WARNING: Do not use this method if the ears are red and swollen or have any open wounds. Garlic and Olive Oil combined are great for treating ear mites. Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty’s ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store. Add several drops to the kitty’s ears once daily for 21 days. The oils have a healing effect so if your kitty has inflamed or painful ears, this will help. These are the best remedies for cats with ear mites and now you can choose the conventional or the holistic approach. Your cat will feel much better and she will love you for it. ||| Thanks. I am also worried that they are susceptible to the coronavirus. ||| Dear Heloise: With everything I've heard about the coronavirus, can my dog get it? — Jackie in Illinois Jackie in Illinois: Here is what the experts know now. While there have been some dogs affected by coronaviruses, this coronavirus (which causes the disease covid-19) is not thought to be a threat to dogs or cats. There’s no evidence that domestic pets play “a significant role in spreading the virus,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people. No special precautions need to be taken with the dog; just practice normal hygiene. Check with your veterinarian for more information. P.S.: It is not necessary for your dog to wear a mask over his nose and mouth, although it does make quite a picture to post! ||| Okay, but I also heard that a few have been reported to be infected. ||| A pet dog in Hong Kong has a “low-level” infection of the coronavirus that causes covid-19 in people, in what may be the first known human-to-animal transmission of the novel coronavirus that has sickened more than 90,000 people worldwide. The case has raised the specter that dogs might be swept into the epidemic, which, even now, public health officials say does not appear to infect or be spread by pets. But experts say much remains unknown about the dog’s infection, and they emphasized the lone case is not yet cause for alarm or reassessments about interactions with pets. The dog is owned by a person who was hospitalized with covid-19, and it has been quarantined since Feb. 26, according to Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. The department said last week that the dog’s “weak positive” test results, from nasal and oral swabs, might have been the result of “environmental contamination,” not infection. But positive tests since then suggest the dog does have a low-level of infection, the department said Wednesday. ||| How can I protect them? ||| Other risk factors may include: stress sanitation issues crowding in the home parasites Cats can also spread the coronavirus in their feces, nasal secretions, and oral secretions. The feline coronavirus can remain inactive and harmless in the home, but it is very easy to destroy the virus with regular cleaning habits. The feline coronavirus poses no threat to humans. How to Prevent the Feline Coronavirus and FIP While it is impossible to know which cats will develop the FIP condition after being infected with the coronavirus, there are several things pet owners can do to possibly prevent the coronavirus from occurring in the first place. Making sure your cat's healthy and has a strong immune system is important in preventing disease. Providing proper nutrition, exercise, and a low-stress environment is the best way to keep your pet healthy. Keeping cats overcrowded may increase stress, lower immunity, and may spread viruses easily, so it is best not to allow this to happen.

That dependence, coupled with financial difficulties that would compel him to agree to a demanding string of performances in London in 2009, set the table for Jackson to become more reliant on Murray, a doctor facing his own money troubles. “Dr. Conrad Murray was not, nor ever would have been, suited to be the caretaker of a complicated patient like Michael Jackson,” the authors state. “And from the moment they met, their fate was sealed.” “83 Minutes” returns often to this idea that Jackson’s demise was inevitable, not only because of Murray’s negligence, but also because of previous doctors who accommodated Jackson’s desire for propofol and other drugs, and Jackson himself, who apparently considered himself immune to the risks. Even though followers of the Murray case and fans of Jackson may be aware of many of the details outlined in “83 Minutes,” revisiting all the pieces of the puzzle in a single volume has a powerful narrative effect.","Why did Michael Jackson go so far to alter his appearance? ||| And as Steve Knopper’s excellent recent book, “MJ: The Genius of Michael Jackson,” suggests, that relationship was a great deal more complicated than any implication that Jackson wanted to be white.

Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry.

Was the disruption widespread? ||| The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease — and hold down the price of your morning cup. At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad. If farmers lose their jobs, it increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence and drug trafficking.","I remember there was a global coffee shortage some time ago.

White, fragrant flowers have appeared, followed by cherry-like fruit, each containing two seeds: Arabica coffee beans, the most popular in the world. But last month, the worst drought in decades hit Brazil's coffee belt region, destroying crop yields and causing the price of coffee to shoot up by more than 50 percent so far this year. The drought is historic, with more than 140 cities in Brazil forced to ration water. The country's leading newspapers reported that some neighborhoods are receiving water only every three days. For now, retail prices for coffee are stable. Roasters typically have enough supplies to cover themselves for a few months. But if the price of the Arabica (pronounced uh-RAB-ick-uh) beans continues to rise, consumers could start seeing the cost of their morning coffee creep up later this year, according to Jack Scoville, a futures market analyst specializing in grains and coffee, among other commodities. ||| What caused the drought? ||| Deforestation causing São Paulo drought Written by Chris Fitch Published in Cities Deforestation near São Paulo, Brazil AFNR05 Feb 2015Brazil possesses 12 per cent of the world’s freshwater, and yet São Paulo – the biggest and richest city in South America – is suffering from severe drought with deforestation getting the blame Water rationing. Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful. ||| I also heard that other Latin American countries had coffee production issues. Was the disruption widespread? ||| The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease — and hold down the price of your morning cup. At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad. If farmers lose their jobs, it increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence and drug trafficking. ||| It sounds like they are not related. What are its origins? And how did it spread? ||| Hemileia vastatrix Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (""Coffea sp."") in order to survive. There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust. Section::::Appearance. The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter. Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter. Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced. Telia are pale yellowish, teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline.","I remember there was a global coffee shortage some time ago.

The US government tried to help the situation. What did they do to help? ||| The Washington region will get some professional counseling in hopes of improving its paltry performance in selling its goods and services abroad. The Global Cities Initiative, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase, will oversee an in-depth study to help the area figure out how to boost exports to offset some of the economic pain caused by the slowdown in federal spending. A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings. That contributed to the region’s weak economic growth rate from 2010 to 2014, which ranked 93rd. Greater Washington’s entry in the initiative was perhaps the most significant of a series of recent efforts to foster increased cooperation among the District, Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs in response to the federal spending cuts known as sequestration.","I remember there was a global coffee shortage some time ago.

Can you tell me more about that? ||| Usually during this time of year, the delicate Arabica coffee plants in the mountains of Brazil, where most of the world's coffee comes from, are maturing. White, fragrant flowers have appeared, followed by cherry-like fruit, each containing two seeds: Arabica coffee beans, the most popular in the world. But last month, the worst drought in decades hit Brazil's coffee belt region, destroying crop yields and causing the price of coffee to shoot up by more than 50 percent so far this year. The drought is historic, with more than 140 cities in Brazil forced to ration water. The country's leading newspapers reported that some neighborhoods are receiving water only every three days. For now, retail prices for coffee are stable. Roasters typically have enough supplies to cover themselves for a few months. But if the price of the Arabica (pronounced uh-RAB-ick-uh) beans continues to rise, consumers could start seeing the cost of their morning coffee creep up later this year, according to Jack Scoville, a futures market analyst specializing in grains and coffee, among other commodities. ||| What caused the drought? ||| Deforestation causing São Paulo drought Written by Chris Fitch Published in Cities Deforestation near São Paulo, Brazil AFNR05 Feb 2015Brazil possesses 12 per cent of the world’s freshwater, and yet São Paulo – the biggest and richest city in South America – is suffering from severe drought with deforestation getting the blame Water rationing. Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful. ||| I also heard that other Latin American countries had coffee production issues. Was the disruption widespread? ||| The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease — and hold down the price of your morning cup. At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad. If farmers lose their jobs, it increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence and drug trafficking. ||| It sounds like they are not related. What are its origins? And how did it spread? ||| Hemileia vastatrix Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (""Coffea sp."") in order to survive. There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust. Section::::Appearance. The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter.

Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced. Telia are pale yellowish, teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline. ||| Okay.

A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings. That contributed to the region’s weak economic growth rate from 2010 to 2014, which ranked 93rd.

Can you tell me more about that? ||| Usually during this time of year, the delicate Arabica coffee plants in the mountains of Brazil, where most of the world's coffee comes from, are maturing. White, fragrant flowers have appeared, followed by cherry-like fruit, each containing two seeds: Arabica coffee beans, the most popular in the world. But last month, the worst drought in decades hit Brazil's coffee belt region, destroying crop yields and causing the price of coffee to shoot up by more than 50 percent so far this year. The drought is historic, with more than 140 cities in Brazil forced to ration water. The country's leading newspapers reported that some neighborhoods are receiving water only every three days. For now, retail prices for coffee are stable. Roasters typically have enough supplies to cover themselves for a few months. But if the price of the Arabica (pronounced uh-RAB-ick-uh) beans continues to rise, consumers could start seeing the cost of their morning coffee creep up later this year, according to Jack Scoville, a futures market analyst specializing in grains and coffee, among other commodities. ||| What caused the drought? ||| Deforestation causing São Paulo drought Written by Chris Fitch Published in Cities Deforestation near São Paulo, Brazil AFNR05 Feb 2015Brazil possesses 12 per cent of the world’s freshwater, and yet São Paulo – the biggest and richest city in South America – is suffering from severe drought with deforestation getting the blame Water rationing. Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful. ||| I also heard that other Latin American countries had coffee production issues. Was the disruption widespread? ||| The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease — and hold down the price of your morning cup. At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad. If farmers lose their jobs, it increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence and drug trafficking. ||| It sounds like they are not related. What are its origins? And how did it spread? ||| Hemileia vastatrix Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (""Coffea sp."") in order to survive. There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust. Section::::Appearance. The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter. Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter. Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced. Telia are pale yellowish, teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline. ||| Okay. The US government tried to help the situation. What did they do to help? ||| The Washington region will get some professional counseling in hopes of improving its paltry performance in selling its goods and services abroad. The Global Cities Initiative, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase, will oversee an in-depth study to help the area figure out how to boost exports to offset some of the economic pain caused by the slowdown in federal spending. A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings. That contributed to the region’s weak economic growth rate from 2010 to 2014, which ranked 93rd. Greater Washington’s entry in the initiative was perhaps the most significant of a series of recent efforts to foster increased cooperation among the District, Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs in response to the federal spending cuts known as sequestration. ||| No, I want to know what they did to help with the coffee rust epidemic in Latin America. ||| And even when it does, it might be struck by the rust fungus as well. As a solution, scientists are currently looking for and breeding rust-resistant coffee varieties (USAID recently donated $5 million towards this goal). Still, there are even reasons to think that these efforts will be futile. """"Coffee doesn't have a very broad genetic base,""""Lombardini says. """"It originated from just a few plants that were taken out of Ethiopia a few hundred years ago, so it has a very narrow, homogenous genome. """"This means that finding variations that might allow for rust-resistance will be difficult. Even if they're identified, a mutation in the fungus' genome could easily allow it to conquer the resistant plants. """" My worry is that producers will over-plant this variety and when the inevitable mutant rust strain capable of infecting it arrives, we will be back to where we are now,"""" Arneson says. And even apart from coffee rust, there are other long-term trends that suggest coffee prices will just continue rising. ||| Okay. What did big coffee companies do? How did they try to help? ||| Still, the companies are trying to ensure their future supply is not affected, so they are working closely with growers on better practices that will help them avoid contamination. “Supporting the farmer’s ability to access information, technology and resources allows them to adapt to these uncertainties and ensures the longevity of our industry’s supply chain,” said Craig Russell, Starbucks Global Coffee executive vice president. Starbucks even bought a Costa Rican farm for research purposes. USAID intends to work with Texas A&amp;M to step up research on rust-resistant coffee varieties and help Latin America better monitor and respond to the fungus. The United States already collaborates with some of the coffee companies and other international organizations to finance replanting of different varieties of trees. The effort is part of the Obama administration’s Feed the Future program, which aims to help rid the world of extreme poverty through agricultural development and improved nutrition. While the effort has helped hungry children around the globe, “we’re at risk of backtracking because of coffee rust,” Shah says. ||| How did all these affect global consumption? ||| When other commodities get expensive, usage can be curtailed — if corn prices went up significantly, for example, Coke might use sugar or another sweetener instead of high-fructose corn syrup in its beverages. The reduced demand for corn helps slow the increase in the cost of it. this years' El niño could bring drought to coffee-growing countries in central america For the most part, coffee doesn't work this way. An estimated54 percent of American adults drink coffee every day, and tea won't suffice. Coffee is an exotic plant that can only be grown in very specific ecosystems thousands of miles away, but we've come to see it as a daily staple, and many Americans who depend on drinking it will do so regardless of price increases. There are also longer-term problems that might cause coffee prices to continue rising in the coming years. One is that substantial solutions to the problems of drought and coffee rust take time. Unlike say, corn, planting more coffee during the next growing season won't mean more beans are available at the next harvest — it takes several years for a coffee plant to reach maturity.","I remember there was a global coffee shortage some time ago.

LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. ||| What did the doctors do? ||| Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders underwent a heart procedure after experiencing chest pains at an event, his campaign said Wednesday. Sanders felt “chest discomfort” Tuesday night at a campaign event, campaign aides said in a statement. Doctors evaluated him, found a blockage in one artery and inserted two stents. The medical problem Sanders experienced — though it can be serious if untreated — is a common affliction in men his age. And the procedure he underwent is one of the most routine performed by cardiologists. “This is a common procedure. It’s very safe. People recover quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve treated businessmen who go back to work the next day. I’ve had patients in the U.S. Senate who have gotten right back to work. Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.” Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque.","I heard Bernie Sanders was ill recently.

Bernie Sanders’s admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate’s age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign. Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return “soon” to the campaign trail. “I’m feeling so much better,” Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane. But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president. The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office. “I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year.","I heard Bernie Sanders was ill recently.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who suffered a heart attack in October and is the oldest major candidate for president in 2020, released information from three of his doctors Monday saying that he sustained “modest heart muscle damage” but is in good health and capable of doing the job. “At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency,” Martin M. LeWinter, attending cardiologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center, wrote in a letter dated Dec. 30. The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote. LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. ||| What did the doctors do? ||| Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders underwent a heart procedure after experiencing chest pains at an event, his campaign said Wednesday. Sanders felt “chest discomfort” Tuesday night at a campaign event, campaign aides said in a statement. Doctors evaluated him, found a blockage in one artery and inserted two stents. The medical problem Sanders experienced — though it can be serious if untreated — is a common affliction in men his age. And the procedure he underwent is one of the most routine performed by cardiologists. “This is a common procedure. It’s very safe. People recover quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve treated businessmen who go back to work the next day. I’ve had patients in the U.S. Senate who have gotten right back to work. Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.” Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque. ||| How did it affect the campaign? ||| Sen. Bernie Sanders’s admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate’s age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign. Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return “soon” to the campaign trail. “I’m feeling so much better,” Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane. But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president. The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office. “I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. ||| How did he attempt to regain the public's confidence? ||| Sen.

What did the records say? ||| Bernie Sanders has done something unusual for him: He changed his mind. While in most cases that’s a good thing (I have come out in favor of flip-flopping), this time it’s getting Sanders into trouble, because what he changed his mind about is releasing his medical records. But before you get too up in arms, we should realize that this issue is less clear-cut than it looks. In a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Sanders was asked if he would release his full medical records, which he said last year that he would do. He has released three letters, from his cardiologists in Vermont and the congressional physician, providing some details of his current health status and prior history. But now, when asked if he’ll be releasing more records, Sanders answered, “I don’t think we will.” Then his spokesperson went on TV and seemed to compare the request for medical records to the racist “birther” campaign against Barack Obama, saying this is reminiscent of “smear” campaigns against other candidates, “questioning where they’re from, their lineage.” That didn’t help.","I heard Bernie Sanders was ill recently.

What happened? ||| Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who suffered a heart attack in October and is the oldest major candidate for president in 2020, released information from three of his doctors Monday saying that he sustained “modest heart muscle damage” but is in good health and capable of doing the job. “At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency,” Martin M. LeWinter, attending cardiologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center, wrote in a letter dated Dec. 30. The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote. LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. ||| What did the doctors do? ||| Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders underwent a heart procedure after experiencing chest pains at an event, his campaign said Wednesday. Sanders felt “chest discomfort” Tuesday night at a campaign event, campaign aides said in a statement. Doctors evaluated him, found a blockage in one artery and inserted two stents. The medical problem Sanders experienced — though it can be serious if untreated — is a common affliction in men his age. And the procedure he underwent is one of the most routine performed by cardiologists. “This is a common procedure. It’s very safe. People recover quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve treated businessmen who go back to work the next day. I’ve had patients in the U.S. Senate who have gotten right back to work. Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.” Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque. ||| How did it affect the campaign? ||| Sen. Bernie Sanders’s admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate’s age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign. Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return “soon” to the campaign trail. “I’m feeling so much better,” Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane. But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president. The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office. “I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. ||| How did he attempt to regain the public's confidence? ||| Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who suffered a heart attack in October and is the oldest major candidate for president in 2020, released information from three of his doctors Monday saying that he sustained “modest heart muscle damage” but is in good health and capable of doing the job. “At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency,” Martin M.

The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote. LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. ||| Okay. What did the records say? ||| Bernie Sanders has done something unusual for him: He changed his mind. While in most cases that’s a good thing (I have come out in favor of flip-flopping), this time it’s getting Sanders into trouble, because what he changed his mind about is releasing his medical records. But before you get too up in arms, we should realize that this issue is less clear-cut than it looks. In a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Sanders was asked if he would release his full medical records, which he said last year that he would do. He has released three letters, from his cardiologists in Vermont and the congressional physician, providing some details of his current health status and prior history. But now, when asked if he’ll be releasing more records, Sanders answered, “I don’t think we will.” Then his spokesperson went on TV and seemed to compare the request for medical records to the racist “birther” campaign against Barack Obama, saying this is reminiscent of “smear” campaigns against other candidates, “questioning where they’re from, their lineage.” That didn’t help. ||| Okay, I'd like to know more about his decision. ||| Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at “the appropriate time.” Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records. Sanders met reporters outside his Burlington home where he has spent the past few days with family, making calls and recovering from a heart attack he suffered during a grass roots fundraising event in Las Vegas last week. The 78-year-old felt chest pains last Tuesday night and was taken to a hospital, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Monday, he was back in Burlington, taking a walk with his wife, Jane, and addressing his campaign on a staff-wide conference call. The campaign had not initially disclosed that Sanders had suffered a heart attack, acknowledging at first only that the stents had been implanted. ||| What about the other candidates? Did they release theirs? ||| The Democratic presidential candidates have been sparring over whether Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been adequately forthcoming about his medical records. At a debate in Las Vegas this month, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said Sanders needs to disclose “full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout.” The Sanders campaign says demanding greater detail on Sanders’s health resembles “the kind of smear” that demands for Barack Obama’s birth certificate represented. It’s easy to understand why Sanders is not eager to release more of his health history. He’s a 78-year-old who weighs 179 pounds and recently had a heart attack. And he’s not the only one. Of the major Democratic candidates, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have released comprehensive medical reports. Of course, President Trump as a candidate famously released — in lieu of his physical — a letter from a doctor declaring that “if elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” — a letter it later emerged that Trump had dictated himself.","I heard Bernie Sanders was ill recently.

In the time I’ve been alive, the average age for becoming a father in America has climbed 3 1 / 2 years, to 30.9, and higher for the college-educated. But that doesn’t mean we’re older versions of our dads. Just as the boomers who came after my dad discovered jogging and yoga and aerobics, my generation of parents has found its own approach to fitness. We’re the ones who entered adulthood — and who now approach middle age — not just clinging to shreds of our athletic identity but fully expecting that our best physical years are still ahead of us.

In the time I’ve been alive, the average age for becoming a father in America has climbed 3 1 / 2 years, to 30.9, and higher for the college-educated. But that doesn’t mean we’re older versions of our dads. Just as the boomers who came after my dad discovered jogging and yoga and aerobics, my generation of parents has found its own approach to fitness. We’re the ones who entered adulthood — and who now approach middle age — not just clinging to shreds of our athletic identity but fully expecting that our best physical years are still ahead of us. It’s us driving the growth of high-intensity exercise chains like CrossFit and Orangetheory. ||| Okay. Should I try CrossFit? ||| It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it. Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc. Rather than training people to become very good at a few exercises, CrossFit prompts them to do things that people do in real life, such as getting up and raising things off the ground, Berger says.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard.

Section::::Criticism.:Exertional rhabdomyolysis. The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company. Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. The company states that exertional rhabdomyolysis can be found in a wide variety of sports and training populations and argues that its critics have conflated CrossFit's high awareness of rhabdomyolysis with high risk.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard.

Do the positives outweigh the negatives? ||| There’s a kind of dedication, a gleam in the eye that many don’t find in a weekly Zumba class. Many CrossFitters have embraced the criticism. A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation. It may not be religious institutionally, but CrossFit does a better job than many religious communities in transforming people’s lives. It may seem strange for what is essentially a fitness program, but CrossFit involves an identity shift that carries over into life well beyond the gym.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard.

We’re the ones who entered adulthood — and who now approach middle age — not just clinging to shreds of our athletic identity but fully expecting that our best physical years are still ahead of us. It’s us driving the growth of high-intensity exercise chains like CrossFit and Orangetheory. ||| Okay. Should I try CrossFit? ||| It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it. Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times.

Section::::Criticism.:Exertional rhabdomyolysis. The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company. Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. The company states that exertional rhabdomyolysis can be found in a wide variety of sports and training populations and argues that its critics have conflated CrossFit's high awareness of rhabdomyolysis with high risk. ||| I would rather be safe. Do the positives outweigh the negatives? ||| There’s a kind of dedication, a gleam in the eye that many don’t find in a weekly Zumba class. Many CrossFitters have embraced the criticism. A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation. It may not be religious institutionally, but CrossFit does a better job than many religious communities in transforming people’s lives. It may seem strange for what is essentially a fitness program, but CrossFit involves an identity shift that carries over into life well beyond the gym. ||| I’ve got four weeks. What about cardio? ||| Conclusion Any exercise is bad for you if you overdo it. You can beat yourself into the ground with weight training just as well as with cardio. To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness. Every person has a different body type, and different body types are naturally better suited to different exercises. Some people do not do well with cardio, and that’s perfectly fine: just don’t do it. The point of this article isn’t to push cardio on people whose bodies don’t respond to it; it’s to point out that some of us are built more for distance work, and that’s OK, too.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard.

What role will diet play? ||| Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard.

In the time I’ve been alive, the average age for becoming a father in America has climbed 3 1 / 2 years, to 30.9, and higher for the college-educated. But that doesn’t mean we’re older versions of our dads. Just as the boomers who came after my dad discovered jogging and yoga and aerobics, my generation of parents has found its own approach to fitness. We’re the ones who entered adulthood — and who now approach middle age — not just clinging to shreds of our athletic identity but fully expecting that our best physical years are still ahead of us. It’s us driving the growth of high-intensity exercise chains like CrossFit and Orangetheory. ||| Okay. Should I try CrossFit? ||| It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it. Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc.

Section::::Criticism.:Exertional rhabdomyolysis. The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company. Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. The company states that exertional rhabdomyolysis can be found in a wide variety of sports and training populations and argues that its critics have conflated CrossFit's high awareness of rhabdomyolysis with high risk. ||| I would rather be safe. Do the positives outweigh the negatives? ||| There’s a kind of dedication, a gleam in the eye that many don’t find in a weekly Zumba class. Many CrossFitters have embraced the criticism. A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation. It may not be religious institutionally, but CrossFit does a better job than many religious communities in transforming people’s lives. It may seem strange for what is essentially a fitness program, but CrossFit involves an identity shift that carries over into life well beyond the gym. ||| I’ve got four weeks. What about cardio? ||| Conclusion Any exercise is bad for you if you overdo it. You can beat yourself into the ground with weight training just as well as with cardio. To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness. Every person has a different body type, and different body types are naturally better suited to different exercises. Some people do not do well with cardio, and that’s perfectly fine: just don’t do it. The point of this article isn’t to push cardio on people whose bodies don’t respond to it; it’s to point out that some of us are built more for distance work, and that’s OK, too. ||| Okay. What role will diet play? ||| Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise. ||| What other meal frequencies can I try? ||| Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live. Studies have shown how the lifespan of people in certain cultures increased due to their diets.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard.

The point of this article isn’t to push cardio on people whose bodies don’t respond to it; it’s to point out that some of us are built more for distance work, and that’s OK, too. ||| Okay. What role will diet play? ||| Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise. ||| What other meal frequencies can I try? ||| Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live. Studies have shown how the lifespan of people in certain cultures increased due to their diets. ||| Which one’s better? ||| It’s one less decision you have to make every day. It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you’re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two. It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique. It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia. As explained here in this TEDx talk by Mark Mattson, Professor at Johns Hopkins University and Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging fasting is grounded in serious research and more studies are coming out showing the benefits: Why fasting bolsters brain power: Mark Mattson at TEDx Johns Hopkins University Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available.","I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard. How do I get started? ||| Watching a video of my daughter, I catch myself in the background and think, Ugh, you’re moving like him already? I worry that my daughter will someday wish I’d work the burger line at the team picnic rather than make her cringe by joining in the game. This anxiety isn’t just mine. ||| Okay. Should I try CrossFit to get fit? ||| It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it.

There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle.","I just watched the Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs.

Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| ""Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged.","I just watched the Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs.

Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived.

Can you tell me about the time when dinosaurs actually existed? ||| When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| ""Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. ||| That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? ||| The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? ||| It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (""""ruling reptiles""""), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters.","I just watched the Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs.

At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. ||| What about the second? ||| The Jurassic Period – 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found.

Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| ""Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. ||| That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? ||| The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? ||| It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (""""ruling reptiles""""), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago).

During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. It was a villain in the science fiction movie Jurassic Park (although it was not of the Jurassic Period.) T-Rex was an aggressive flesh eater.","I just watched the Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs.

Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| ""Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. ||| That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? ||| The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? ||| It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (""""ruling reptiles""""), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. ||| What about the second? ||| The Jurassic Period – 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago. There was also a pigeon-size dinosaur, Epidexipteryx hui, whose remains were discovered in the hills of Inner Mongolia in late 2007. ||| And the last? ||| """"The Cretaceous Period – 145.5 to 65.5 million years ago The Cretaceous Period is the last of the three periods of the Mezoaic Era and is described as the last period with non-flying dinosaurs, a period ending 65.5 million years ago. During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. It was a villain in the science fiction movie Jurassic Park (although it was not of the Jurassic Period.) T-Rex was an aggressive flesh eater. ||| What happened to dinosaurs after then? ||| Most dinosaur species lived and died out during this period, but at the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), all remaining types of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds which had already evolved, and are widely believed to be descended from dinosaurs) died out. At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the """"K-T boundary"""", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the """"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction"""". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called """"theories"""", however in this case """"hypotheses"""" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as """"hypothesis"""" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence).","I just watched the Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs.

Can you tell me about the time when dinosaurs actually existed? ||| When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| ""Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. ||| That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? ||| The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? ||| It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (""""ruling reptiles""""), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. ||| What about the second? ||| The Jurassic Period – 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago. There was also a pigeon-size dinosaur, Epidexipteryx hui, whose remains were discovered in the hills of Inner Mongolia in late 2007. ||| And the last? ||| """"The Cretaceous Period – 145.5 to 65.5 million years ago The Cretaceous Period is the last of the three periods of the Mezoaic Era and is described as the last period with non-flying dinosaurs, a period ending 65.5 million years ago. During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. It was a villain in the science fiction movie Jurassic Park (although it was not of the Jurassic Period.) T-Rex was an aggressive flesh eater. ||| What happened to dinosaurs after then? ||| Most dinosaur species lived and died out during this period, but at the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), all remaining types of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds which had already evolved, and are widely believed to be descended from dinosaurs) died out. At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the """"K-T boundary"""", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the """"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction"""". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called """"theories"""", however in this case """"hypotheses"""" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as """"hypothesis"""" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence). ||| How do the evolution of dinosaurs across the three periods compare? ||| But the fact is that dinosaur diversity reached its peak in the ensuing Cretaceous period. Geography and Climate During the Jurrasic Period The Jurassic period witnessed the breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent into two big pieces, Gondwana in the south (corresponding to modern-day Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica) and Laurasia in the north (Eurasia and North America). At about the same time, intra-continental lakes and rivers formed that opened new evolutionary niches for aquatic and terrestrial life. The climate was hot and humid, with steady rainfall, ideal conditions for the explosive spread of lush, green plants. Terrestrial Life During the Jurassic Period Dinosaurs: During the Jurassic period, relatives of the small, quadrupedal, plant-eating prosauropods of the Triassic period gradually evolved into multi-ton sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. This period also saw the concurrent rise of medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Megalosaurus. This helps explain the evolution of the earliest, armor-bearing ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. Mammals: The mouse-sized early mammals of the Jurassic period, only recently evolved from their Triassic ancestors, kept a low profile, scurrying around at night or nesting high up in trees so as not to get squashed under the feet of bigger dinosaurs.","I just watched the Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs.

People shuffled into the plentiful limoncello shops and gathered on the steep staircase leading to the Duomo di Sant’ Andrea, the 9th-century Romanesque cathedral that stands at the heart of the town. Keeping a watchful eye over the plaza were an elderly couple, high on their top-floor balcony. Wrapped in snug dressing gowns, the pair surveyed the scene in silence. Amalfi’s surge in popularity began in Edwardian times, when wealthy families from across Europe deemed it a pleasant place to spend their winters. By the 1950s, it had gained a reputation for glamour and sophistication. Today, it attracts travelers in search of fine food, eye-popping scenery and weather that’s nothing short of sublime. Rising early the next morning to the chimes of the cathedral, we pulled on our walking boots, grabbed our daypacks — laden with picnic snacks — and set off for Praiano, a westward journey of about seven miles.","I want to go on vacation somewhere in Europe with good food.

August being the height of the high season, we predictably had to battle our way through hordes of fellow tourists. Yet not even overcrowding (or the political chaos in Rome) can spoil Bella Italia. You can easily get punch-drunk on its splendors, from Bernini’s sublime statues to the Amalfi Coast’s majestic cliffs. One of the highlights was a few nights on Capri, a small isle in the Tyrrhenian Sea that has hosted pleasure seekers since the days when Emperor Tiberius built villas there. ||| What should I not miss on the Coast? ||| Details, Amalfi Coast It was late morning by the time my friend Karen and I arrived in Amalfi (via bus, train and boat from Naples), and the central plaza was buzzing. People shuffled into the plentiful limoncello shops and gathered on the steep staircase leading to the Duomo di Sant’ Andrea, the 9th-century Romanesque cathedral that stands at the heart of the town. Keeping a watchful eye over the plaza were an elderly couple, high on their top-floor balcony. Wrapped in snug dressing gowns, the pair surveyed the scene in silence. Amalfi’s surge in popularity began in Edwardian times, when wealthy families from across Europe deemed it a pleasant place to spend their winters. By the 1950s, it had gained a reputation for glamour and sophistication. Today, it attracts travelers in search of fine food, eye-popping scenery and weather that’s nothing short of sublime.

Directly opposite Pansa is Bar Francese and this is where prime aperitivo hour occurs in Amalfi for those holidaymakers and touring Italians who want to be seen. Nearby is Bar Savoia for very good cakes to take away. Up the main concourse from the piazza check out Pasticceria Leone which has excellent sweets, biscuits (all made on site) and espresso. There is a small bar next to a mini-mart in Piazza dei Dodgi, the little square off the Duomo, and it is very popular for locals and people watching. Grand Caffe overlooking the main beach is also nice for a drink (their light lunches are very hit and miss however) with lovely relaxing views up the coast while the Marina Grande restaurant operate a bar on the beach with funky decor and candle-light, which is a very good choice on a hot summer night. Bar Flavio Gioia opposite the main ferry pier and parking bay has the best gelato in town and offers a good pit stop before taking a bus from the nearby terminal or catching a ferry.","I want to go on vacation somewhere in Europe with good food.

What’s that? ||| A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area. One popular way to do this was by constructing massive buildings that required lots of money, manpower, and technological innovation.","I want to go on vacation somewhere in Europe with good food.

Downspout disconnection could be especially beneficial to cities with combined sewer systems. Examples Milwaukee Downspout Disconnection Exit Portland, OR, Downspout Disconnection Program Top of Page Rainwater Harvesting This rainwater harvesting system is adapted to the architecture of the building and its surroundings. Rainwater harvesting systems collect and store rainfall for later use. When designed appropriately, they slow and reduce runoff and provide a source of water. This practice could be particularly valuable in arid regions, where it could reduce demands on increasingly limited water supplies. Examples New York City Rain Barrel Giveaway Program Arizona Municipal Water Users Association Top of Page Rain Gardens A rain garden can be beautiful as well as functional. Rain gardens are versatile features that can be installed in almost any unpaved space. Also known as bioretention, or bioinfiltration, cells, they are shallow, vegetated basins that collect and absorb runoff from rooftops, sidewalks, and streets.

You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof.","Why is it important to reduce runoff in urban areas? ||| Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere.

How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof).","Why is it important to reduce runoff in urban areas? ||| Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere.

Rain barrels vary from a smaller 15 gallon size to larger commercial rain barrels that can hold upwards of 1,000 gallons. They are also usually opaque so that the stored water is not exposed to sunlight which limits that amount of algae that can grow inside the barrel. The different rain barrels materials include: Plastic or polyethylene One of the more popular options Its lightweight and cheap Tends to fall apart in the outdoors so it needs to be stored where there is enough UV protection Can be found in all shapes and colors Stone or ceramic clay Great for catching small amount of rain Very decorative and great for small gardens Can be difficult to install Wood Gives your home a rustic feel Water cannot be contaminated with BPAMore expensive than plastic Has a heavier catchment system Can be purchased in beech wood, hickory, oak and cedar Metal Great for large rain storage Can use flexible membrane liners Is used for more permanent rain storage Not as attractive for residential use Storing Rain Water In regions where drought is a common occurrence, water storage tanks can be a great investment.

Numerous watersheds within Los Angeles County, California do not meet state water quality standards, despite spending $100 million a year on clean water programs to combat issues such as urban runoff. To combat this problem, officials have introduced a measure that would assess a fee to homeowners and local businesses in attempt to raise $290 million for effective urban runoff management. Section::::Prevention and mitigation. Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called best management practices (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions. /div Pollution prevention practices include low impact development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides). ||| What practices could I use at home to help? ||| You can use it to store stormwater and/or allow stormwater to infiltrate into the soil. Downspout disconnection could be especially beneficial to cities with combined sewer systems. Examples Milwaukee Downspout Disconnection Exit Portland, OR, Downspout Disconnection Program Top of Page Rainwater Harvesting This rainwater harvesting system is adapted to the architecture of the building and its surroundings. Rainwater harvesting systems collect and store rainfall for later use. When designed appropriately, they slow and reduce runoff and provide a source of water. This practice could be particularly valuable in arid regions, where it could reduce demands on increasingly limited water supplies. Examples New York City Rain Barrel Giveaway Program Arizona Municipal Water Users Association Top of Page Rain Gardens A rain garden can be beautiful as well as functional. Rain gardens are versatile features that can be installed in almost any unpaved space. Also known as bioretention, or bioinfiltration, cells, they are shallow, vegetated basins that collect and absorb runoff from rooftops, sidewalks, and streets. This practice mimics natural hydrology by infiltrating, and evaporating and transpiring—or “evapotranspiring”—stormwater runoff. ||| Maybe I could collect it for my garden. I’d like to learn more about using a barrel.  What should I consider? ||| Collecting rain for use later also keeps it from entering your foundation, crawl space or basement. Some cities offer financial incentives for using rainwater for irrigation as a supplement to municipal water. Caution Check for restrictions on rain barrels and rain harvesting in your area. You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof. ||| I live in Seattle and have a big lawn. How big should it be? How much can I save? ||| Buy a rain barrel Seattle Rain Barrel User's Guide (pdf) - Learn more, including calculating how much rain you can gather and store. How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof). ||| That sounds like a lot of water. How big are normal barrels? And what material should I get? What are the pros and cons of different materials? ||| They are available in ceramic, wood, metal, stone and plastic. Rain barrels vary from a smaller 15 gallon size to larger commercial rain barrels that can hold upwards of 1,000 gallons. They are also usually opaque so that the stored water is not exposed to sunlight which limits that amount of algae that can grow inside the barrel. The different rain barrels materials include: Plastic or polyethylene One of the more popular options Its lightweight and cheap Tends to fall apart in the outdoors so it needs to be stored where there is enough UV protection Can be found in all shapes and colors Stone or ceramic clay Great for catching small amount of rain Very decorative and great for small gardens Can be difficult to install Wood Gives your home a rustic feel Water cannot be contaminated with BPAMore expensive than plastic Has a heavier catchment system Can be purchased in beech wood, hickory, oak and cedar Metal Great for large rain storage Can use flexible membrane liners Is used for more permanent rain storage Not as attractive for residential use Storing Rain Water In regions where drought is a common occurrence, water storage tanks can be a great investment. If you live in a region where there is a lot of rain, than a small rain barrel will be adequate to store your water needs for sporadic dry spells. ||| Is it safe to use on my garden? ||| From the Seattle and King County Public Health Department.

Section::::Prevention and mitigation. Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called best management practices (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions. /div Pollution prevention practices include low impact development (LID) or green infrastructure techniques - known as Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) in the UK, and Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of green roofs and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides). ||| What practices could I use at home to help? ||| You can use it to store stormwater and/or allow stormwater to infiltrate into the soil. Downspout disconnection could be especially beneficial to cities with combined sewer systems. Examples Milwaukee Downspout Disconnection Exit Portland, OR, Downspout Disconnection Program Top of Page Rainwater Harvesting This rainwater harvesting system is adapted to the architecture of the building and its surroundings. Rainwater harvesting systems collect and store rainfall for later use. When designed appropriately, they slow and reduce runoff and provide a source of water. This practice could be particularly valuable in arid regions, where it could reduce demands on increasingly limited water supplies.

Rain gardens are versatile features that can be installed in almost any unpaved space. Also known as bioretention, or bioinfiltration, cells, they are shallow, vegetated basins that collect and absorb runoff from rooftops, sidewalks, and streets. This practice mimics natural hydrology by infiltrating, and evaporating and transpiring—or “evapotranspiring”—stormwater runoff. ||| Maybe I could collect it for my garden.

Some cities offer financial incentives for using rainwater for irrigation as a supplement to municipal water. Caution Check for restrictions on rain barrels and rain harvesting in your area. You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof. ||| I live in Seattle and have a big lawn. How big should it be? How much can I save? ||| Buy a rain barrel Seattle Rain Barrel User's Guide (pdf) - Learn more, including calculating how much rain you can gather and store. How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof). ||| That sounds like a lot of water. How big are normal barrels? And what material should I get? What are the pros and cons of different materials? ||| They are available in ceramic, wood, metal, stone and plastic. Rain barrels vary from a smaller 15 gallon size to larger commercial rain barrels that can hold upwards of 1,000 gallons. They are also usually opaque so that the stored water is not exposed to sunlight which limits that amount of algae that can grow inside the barrel. The different rain barrels materials include: Plastic or polyethylene One of the more popular options Its lightweight and cheap Tends to fall apart in the outdoors so it needs to be stored where there is enough UV protection Can be found in all shapes and colors Stone or ceramic clay Great for catching small amount of rain Very decorative and great for small gardens Can be difficult to install Wood Gives your home a rustic feel Water cannot be contaminated with BPAMore expensive than plastic Has a heavier catchment system Can be purchased in beech wood, hickory, oak and cedar Metal Great for large rain storage Can use flexible membrane liners Is used for more permanent rain storage Not as attractive for residential use Storing Rain Water In regions where drought is a common occurrence, water storage tanks can be a great investment. If you live in a region where there is a lot of rain, than a small rain barrel will be adequate to store your water needs for sporadic dry spells. ||| Is it safe to use on my garden? ||| From the Seattle and King County Public Health Department.

Step 6Position and level the barrel. Step 7Direct the barrel's overflow to keep water away from the foundation of your home. Your barrel may come with an overflow hose, or you may need to place a gutter splash block under the overflow outlet. Using a Rain Barrel The water you collect in a rain barrel is untreated. The absence of chlorine and other chemicals is good for plants, but humans and pets shouldn't consume it and you shouldn't use it for cooking, washing your hands or washing food. If you use the water to irrigate herb, vegetable or fruit plants, apply it to the soil, not the plants. Wash the vegetables and fruit in tap water before eating or cooking them. Use soap and warm tap water to wash any parts of your body that touch the collected water. Make sure your rain barrel doesn't cause mosquito problems.","Why is it important to reduce runoff in urban areas? ||| Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere.

Step 6Position and level the barrel. Step 7Direct the barrel's overflow to keep water away from the foundation of your home. Your barrel may come with an overflow hose, or you may need to place a gutter splash block under the overflow outlet. Using a Rain Barrel The water you collect in a rain barrel is untreated. The absence of chlorine and other chemicals is good for plants, but humans and pets shouldn't consume it and you shouldn't use it for cooking, washing your hands or washing food. If you use the water to irrigate herb, vegetable or fruit plants, apply it to the soil, not the plants. Wash the vegetables and fruit in tap water before eating or cooking them. Use soap and warm tap water to wash any parts of your body that touch the collected water. Make sure your rain barrel doesn't cause mosquito problems. ||| You also mentioned rain gardens earlier.

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent.

Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible.","What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult).

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. ||| What are the causes of it? ||| This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk? ||| Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction.

The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65.

Is that true?,"What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. ||| What are the causes of it? ||| This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk? ||| Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. ||| What is a safe amount to drink daily? ||| A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. ||| What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? ||| S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005.

As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. ||| But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner.

Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark.

What is the French government's attitude towards pregnant women drinking? ||| Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned. What did  advise on safe consumption levels of alcohol?,"What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. ||| What are the causes of it? ||| This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk? ||| Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. ||| What is a safe amount to drink daily? ||| A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. ||| What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? ||| S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005. The advisory states in part, “Based on the current, best science available we now know the following: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy;Alcohol can damage the embryo or fetus at any stage of pregnancy;Damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant;The cognitive effects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are lifelong.”“For these reasons: A pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy;A pregnant woman who has already consumed alcohol during pregnancy should stop in order to minimize further risk;A woman who is considering becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol.”About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. ||| But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner.

One mom tells the Post that her doctor actually told her to """"go home and drink a glass of wine,"""" after having an amniocentesis test because it would help calm painful uterine contractions after the procedure. This would surprise many American moms, but not Europeans; 2008 study published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research said more than 50 percent of French women drank at least once during their pregnancy, compared to only 12 percent of American women. ||| So you mean that the US suggestion may be too strict?

At the heart of this debate is the research itself. So, what do we actually know about light drinking during pregnancy? Let’s start with alcohol and the risk of miscarriage. Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark. The risk rose with greater intakes. Drinking 4 or more drinks per week during the first trimester more than doubled the odds of a miscarriage. ||| Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned. What advice did it give for safety? ||| To minimize health risks, the optimal amount of alcohol someone should consume is none. That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you. What’s best for you is to not drink at all,” she said.","What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult).

What did  advise on safe consumption levels of alcohol? ||| I’d like to stop. What are some treatment options for alcoholism?,"What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. ||| What are the causes of it? ||| This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk? ||| Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. ||| What is a safe amount to drink daily? ||| A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. ||| What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? ||| S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005. The advisory states in part, “Based on the current, best science available we now know the following: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy;Alcohol can damage the embryo or fetus at any stage of pregnancy;Damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant;The cognitive effects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are lifelong.”“For these reasons: A pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy;A pregnant woman who has already consumed alcohol during pregnancy should stop in order to minimize further risk;A woman who is considering becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol.”About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. ||| But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner. Is that true? ||| ""Why Can't A Pregnant Woman Have A Drink? Margaret Hartmann8/24/10 11:15am 683Many medical experts say it's OK for pregnant woman to have one or two glasses of wine a week, and drinking while pregnant is common in Europe. So why is moderate drinking during pregnancy still taboo in America? While the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still says that """"no amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy,"""" the New York Post reports that a 2009 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children whose mothers had one or two drinks per week while pregnant did not have an increased risk of cognitive defects compared to those who had no alcohol. One mom tells the Post that her doctor actually told her to """"go home and drink a glass of wine,"""" after having an amniocentesis test because it would help calm painful uterine contractions after the procedure. This would surprise many American moms, but not Europeans; 2008 study published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research said more than 50 percent of French women drank at least once during their pregnancy, compared to only 12 percent of American women. ||| So you mean that the US suggestion may be too strict?

At the heart of this debate is the research itself. So, what do we actually know about light drinking during pregnancy? Let’s start with alcohol and the risk of miscarriage. Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark. The risk rose with greater intakes. Drinking 4 or more drinks per week during the first trimester more than doubled the odds of a miscarriage. ||| Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned. What advice did it give for safety? ||| To minimize health risks, the optimal amount of alcohol someone should consume is none. That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you. What’s best for you is to not drink at all,” she said. ||| I’d like to stop. What are some treatment options? ||| Page contents Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)Varenicline (Champix)Bupropion (Zyban)E-cigarettes If you want to stop smoking, several different treatments are available from shops, pharmacies and on prescription to help you beat your addiction and reduce withdrawal symptoms. The best treatment for you will depend on your personal preference, your age, whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding and any medical conditions you have. Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice. Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service. The treatments available are outlined below. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine. NRT is a medication that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking.","What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult).

To boost your levels of dopamine, dopamine rich foods may not be adequate. ||| How does the phenylalanine convert to tyrosine? ||| Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure. Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain.","What are the mechanisms of depression? ||| The major neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin.

Many experts believe that an imbalance among the different neurotransmitters is the cause of depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of trazodone is unknown, it probably improves symptoms of depression by inhibiting the uptake of serotonin by nerves in the brain. This results in more serotonin to stimulate other nerves. Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin. ||| What is the role of serotonin? ||| Techniques For Anxiety The Role of Serotonin When it comes to biological factors for depression, it is commonly accepted that serotonin plays a crucial role. In the brain, this neurotransmitter acts as a relay, transporting messages from one area to another. Given this critical task, an imbalance in serotonin levels may influence our emotions. Since depression is often characterized by negative emotions, the link between this mood disorder and serotonin is obvious. Happiness Hormones Other chemicals that play a crucial role in mood disorders are dopamine and endorphins. ||| How can I balance it? ||| But you can create your own dopamine rewards by setting a goal, then take small steps toward it every day. This can be starting a new exercise program, learning French, or challenging yourself to drive home from work a different way every day, preferably without the use of your GPS. According to Dr. Graziano Breuning, working on a goal without fail for 45 days will train your brain to stimulate dopamine production in a new way. Dopamine and Mental Conditions Dopamine plays such an important role in how we live our lives, it’s no surprise that when the dopamine system is out of balance it can contribute to many mental conditions. ( 35)Here are three of the most common conditions that have a dopamine connection. ||| What foods boost it? ||| So the way to increase central nervous system neurotransmitter levels is to provide proper amounts of the amino acid precursor. Bananas, especially ripe bananas, are an exceptional food for regulating dopamine because they have a high concentration of tyrosine. Other foods that increase dopamine through the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine include almonds, apples, watermelons, cherries, yogurt, beans, eggs and meats. It is important to note that dopamine foods alone generally do not have the therapeutic amino acid levels necessary to boost dopamine levels for someone experiencing major depressive disorder. To boost your levels of dopamine, dopamine rich foods may not be adequate. ||| How does the phenylalanine convert to tyrosine? ||| Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure. Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain. ||| Can these drugs alleviate depression? ||| Predictions from the Catecholamine Theory of Mood The catecholamine theory makes the following predictions: Drugs wich destroy CAs should produce depression Drugs which increase CAs should alleviate depression Drugs used to test the Catecholamine Theory of Mood You now have a body of knowledge that can be used to test the catecholamine theory of mood. Drug Effect on the catecholamines DA and NA Predicted effect on depression Reserpine depletes CAs produce depression Tetrabenazine (TBZ) depletes CAs for a shorter length of time than reserpine produce depression Alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT)inhibits the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase - stops CA synthesis produce depression FLA-63 inhibits the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase - stops conversion of DA into NA.

Many experts believe that an imbalance among the different neurotransmitters is the cause of depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of trazodone is unknown, it probably improves symptoms of depression by inhibiting the uptake of serotonin by nerves in the brain. This results in more serotonin to stimulate other nerves. Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin. ||| What is the role of serotonin? ||| Techniques For Anxiety The Role of Serotonin When it comes to biological factors for depression, it is commonly accepted that serotonin plays a crucial role. In the brain, this neurotransmitter acts as a relay, transporting messages from one area to another. Given this critical task, an imbalance in serotonin levels may influence our emotions. Since depression is often characterized by negative emotions, the link between this mood disorder and serotonin is obvious. Happiness Hormones Other chemicals that play a crucial role in mood disorders are dopamine and endorphins. ||| How can I balance it? ||| But you can create your own dopamine rewards by setting a goal, then take small steps toward it every day. This can be starting a new exercise program, learning French, or challenging yourself to drive home from work a different way every day, preferably without the use of your GPS. According to Dr. Graziano Breuning, working on a goal without fail for 45 days will train your brain to stimulate dopamine production in a new way. Dopamine and Mental Conditions Dopamine plays such an important role in how we live our lives, it’s no surprise that when the dopamine system is out of balance it can contribute to many mental conditions. ( 35)Here are three of the most common conditions that have a dopamine connection. ||| What foods boost it? ||| So the way to increase central nervous system neurotransmitter levels is to provide proper amounts of the amino acid precursor. Bananas, especially ripe bananas, are an exceptional food for regulating dopamine because they have a high concentration of tyrosine. Other foods that increase dopamine through the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine include almonds, apples, watermelons, cherries, yogurt, beans, eggs and meats. It is important to note that dopamine foods alone generally do not have the therapeutic amino acid levels necessary to boost dopamine levels for someone experiencing major depressive disorder. To boost your levels of dopamine, dopamine rich foods may not be adequate. ||| How does the phenylalanine convert to tyrosine? ||| Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure.

Bench was Rookie of the Year in 1968. In 1970 at age 22, he led the Big Red Machine with 45 home runs and franchise record 148 RBIs while catching 158 games for League MVP. He was MVP again in 1972 when his production dropped to 40 home runs and only 125 RBIs. Bench was a 10-time Gold Glover and 14-time All Star. Bench caught 100 or more games for a record-setting 13 consecutive seasons. Bench hit 389 career home runs.

An autobiography published in 1979 called ""Catch You Later"" was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments.

Athletically speaking, that is. “Bobby is just a fine young man,” Johnny said recently. “I couldn’t be prouder of him.” Bobby, who is 6-foot-7 and weighs 225 pounds, played some baseball when younger. Bobby said he got some of his height from his mother, Laura, who is tall at 6-foot. (Johnny is 6-1). Bobby mostly played first base in baseball. He was a decent athlete but, as a baseball player, was no Johnny Bench. Who could be? When Bobby was cut from St. Xavier baseball tryouts as both a freshman and a sophomore, he realized how impossible it could be to be who he was.","Who are the greatest catchers of all time? ||| ""Baseball Card Hall of Fame Johnny Bench 1974 #010by William Szczepanek This 1974 card of Johnny Bench shows him in the year he caught 160 games and led the league with 129 RBIs.

The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

What is that? ||| ""The Heat Pump The heat pump is merely an air conditioner with a reversing valve, check valves, and a defrost mechanism. The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. The Short Story Let me contrast a heat pump with a regular AC using electric strip heat. A heat pump will save you 50% in the heating mode, but it will lose 10% when cooling. For the Brazos Valley, what you lose in the summer will not be recovered in the winter. Numerous AC researchers and managers of utilities—with the exception of one man—have agreed in their conversations with me: A heat pump, in our community, is not cost effective. There is no utility savings, and it can be very expensive to repair. The Entire Story The utility companies push heat pumps because they want to balance the load on their generators, but there is absolutely no other justification for a heat pump in our community. The homeowner has nothing to gain and everything to lose. ||| What are some other choices to heat my home? ||| If your home is currently heated by an inefficient heat source, for example oil, you’ll see much lower heating costs with a heat pump. The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. ||| What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? ||| Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

What is that? ||| ""The Heat Pump The heat pump is merely an air conditioner with a reversing valve, check valves, and a defrost mechanism. The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. The Short Story Let me contrast a heat pump with a regular AC using electric strip heat. A heat pump will save you 50% in the heating mode, but it will lose 10% when cooling. For the Brazos Valley, what you lose in the summer will not be recovered in the winter. Numerous AC researchers and managers of utilities—with the exception of one man—have agreed in their conversations with me: A heat pump, in our community, is not cost effective. There is no utility savings, and it can be very expensive to repair. The Entire Story The utility companies push heat pumps because they want to balance the load on their generators, but there is absolutely no other justification for a heat pump in our community. The homeowner has nothing to gain and everything to lose. ||| What are some other choices to heat my home? ||| If your home is currently heated by an inefficient heat source, for example oil, you’ll see much lower heating costs with a heat pump. The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. ||| What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? ||| Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly. ||| A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? ||| Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type. Though the cost of the heat pump and labor fees may be a significant investment, it can drastically reduce your energy consumption. Consider the following factors before installing a heat pump: On This Page: Heat Pump Installation Cost Considerations Heat Pump Prices Types of Heat Pumps How Does a Heat Pump Work? Benefits of a Heat Pump Heat Pump Tax Credits &amp; Rebates Installation Cost Considerations The difficulty associated with the excavation of the ground will affect the installation costs. Make sure to consult a few installation professionals and get a number of bids, as this installation can vary significantly in price. ||| Which type is better in terms of efficiency? ||| Geothermal vs. Air-Source Heat Pumps – Weighing the Pros and Cons Nov 8, 2013 | Blog The geothermal heat pump is quickly gaining popularity for efficient, eco-friendly heating. In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. ||| How many years will it take to recoup the investment? ||| Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. """"It's a win-win arrangement,"""" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. ||| How many years will it take to recoup the investment? ||| Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. """"It's a win-win arrangement,"""" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities. ||| That’s great. What makes it so efficient? ||| It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. The Short Story Let me contrast a heat pump with a regular AC using electric strip heat. A heat pump will save you 50% in the heating mode, but it will lose 10% when cooling. For the Brazos Valley, what you lose in the summer will not be recovered in the winter. Numerous AC researchers and managers of utilities—with the exception of one man—have agreed in their conversations with me: A heat pump, in our community, is not cost effective. There is no utility savings, and it can be very expensive to repair. The Entire Story The utility companies push heat pumps because they want to balance the load on their generators, but there is absolutely no other justification for a heat pump in our community. The homeowner has nothing to gain and everything to lose. ||| What are some other choices to heat my home? ||| If your home is currently heated by an inefficient heat source, for example oil, you’ll see much lower heating costs with a heat pump. The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. ||| What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? ||| Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly. ||| A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? ||| Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type. Though the cost of the heat pump and labor fees may be a significant investment, it can drastically reduce your energy consumption.

But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones. ||| If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

What is that? ||| ""The Heat Pump The heat pump is merely an air conditioner with a reversing valve, check valves, and a defrost mechanism. The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. The Short Story Let me contrast a heat pump with a regular AC using electric strip heat. A heat pump will save you 50% in the heating mode, but it will lose 10% when cooling. For the Brazos Valley, what you lose in the summer will not be recovered in the winter. Numerous AC researchers and managers of utilities—with the exception of one man—have agreed in their conversations with me: A heat pump, in our community, is not cost effective. There is no utility savings, and it can be very expensive to repair. The Entire Story The utility companies push heat pumps because they want to balance the load on their generators, but there is absolutely no other justification for a heat pump in our community. The homeowner has nothing to gain and everything to lose. ||| What are some other choices to heat my home? ||| If your home is currently heated by an inefficient heat source, for example oil, you’ll see much lower heating costs with a heat pump. The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. ||| What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? ||| Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly. ||| A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? ||| Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type. Though the cost of the heat pump and labor fees may be a significant investment, it can drastically reduce your energy consumption.

Make sure to consult a few installation professionals and get a number of bids, as this installation can vary significantly in price. ||| Which type is better in terms of efficiency? ||| Geothermal vs. Air-Source Heat Pumps – Weighing the Pros and Cons Nov 8, 2013 | Blog The geothermal heat pump is quickly gaining popularity for efficient, eco-friendly heating. In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. ||| How many years will it take to recoup the investment? ||| Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. """"It's a win-win arrangement,"""" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities. ||| That’s great. What makes it so efficient? ||| It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. ||| Cool science. But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones. ||| If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. ||| Tell me about AC systems. ||| An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses. The compressor, the “heart” of the car’s air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing can fail. If the bearing or clutch have failed, it is recommended that the compressor be replaced.","I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump.

What is that? |||  ||| What are some other choices besides a heat pump to heat my home? |||  ||| What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? |||  ||| A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? |||  ||| Which type of heat pump is better in terms of efficiency, a geothermal heat pump or an air-source heat pump? |||  ||| How many years will it take to recoup the investment in a geothermal heat pump? |||  ||| That’s great.

What is that? ||| The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. ||| What are some other choices besides a heat pump to heat my home? ||| If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. ||| What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? ||| Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. ||| A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? ||| Consider the following factors before installing a heat pump: On This Page: Heat Pump Installation Cost Considerations Heat Pump Prices Types of Heat Pumps How Does a Heat Pump Work? Benefits of a Heat Pump Heat Pump Tax Credits &amp; Rebates Installation Cost Considerations The difficulty associated with the excavation of the ground will affect the installation costs. ||| Which type of heat pump is better in terms of efficiency, a geothermal heat pump or an air-source heat pump? ||| Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. ||| How many years will it take to recoup the investment in a geothermal heat pump? ||| Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. ||| That’s great.
