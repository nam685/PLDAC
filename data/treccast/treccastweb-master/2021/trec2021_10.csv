Benefits of a Heat Pump Heat Pump Tax Credits &amp; Rebates Installation Cost Considerations The difficulty associated with the excavation of the ground will affect the installation costs. ||| Which type of heat pump is better in terms of efficiency, a geothermal heat pump or an air-source heat pump? ||| Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. ||| How many years will it take to recoup the investment in a geothermal heat pump? ||| A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. ||| That’s great. What makes a geothermal heat pump so efficient? ||| A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. |||| Reformulation: "
