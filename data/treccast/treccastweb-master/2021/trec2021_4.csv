The organization group Longleaf Alliance defines a fire climax community as ""a plant and animal community that is limited by and adapted to an early successional stage by frequent fire disturbances"". ||| Let’s talk about other environmental influences besides fire. How does agriculture affect an ecosystem? ||| That agriculture has a huge effect on our ecosystems: pesticides and other toxic chemicals used in food production can wash downstream, killing many types of animals, polluting our waterways and even making humans ill. Fertilizers can wash downstream, causing """"blooms"""" or large populations of algae and bacteria, which can harm fish populations. ||| Can agriculture cause desertification? ||| Most plants, unless specially adapted to desert conditions, can not thrive in dry, arid conditions. Farming is major cause of desertification - soils need time to rest between crops but pressures to provide food and an income often lead to soil and land being over used and becoming tired. ||| What does it mean for soil to be tired? ||| Section::::Regenerative agriculture. Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. ||| Permaculture sounds like organic farming, how are they related? ||| According to Permaculture Planet.com:“Permaculture is an interdisciplinary earth science which encompasses many kinds of appropriate technologies and sustainable design methodologies, such as; renewable energy, water conservation, organic food production, ecological building techniques, micro-economics and more. In a world of rapid ecological change &amp; seemingly insurmountable social &amp; environmental problems, Permaculture offers practical solutions using design principles drawn from the observation of natural systems. |||| Reformulation: "

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. ||| Utterance: What were Ziegler’s improvements to the use of anabolic steroids in athletes? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (""ca. "" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. ||| Why are steroids banned in sports? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. ||| Are there visible signs that someone is using steroids? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It has also been revealed that many people who administer excessively high doses of anabolic steroids tend to experience mood, sexuality, and aggression changes during or after the use of these drugs, though these effects may be rapid or involve long-term modifications at the genomic level. ||| That sounds easy to spot.
