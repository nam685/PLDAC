Honey doesn't spoil like other foods and even if it has turned cloudy, it's still safe to eat. While you may be used to seeing clear, golden honey, cloudy honey is normal and natural.Clouding is caused by crystallization of the sugars and doesn't affect the taste or safety of the honey and is reversible.If the honey is in a jar, you can warm it on the stove. It doesn't harm honey to store it in the refrigerator, but it isn't necessary and will make honey cloudy and, sometimes, develop graininess as it crystallizes. 2  You can also warm honey in the microwave, as long as it is in a microwave-safe container and you use your microwave's lowest setting.","What are some interesting facts about bees? ||| Fun facts about bees: 1  Honeybees are the only insect that produces food eaten by humans. 2  Worker honeybees are female. ||| Why doesn't honey spoil? ||| Diana Taliun/iStock/Getty Images.

Social Security is funded primarily through payroll taxes called Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). ||| Was it mandatory? ||| Over the years, the law changed. Most employees have Social Security protection, because. their states have special agreements with the Social Security. Administration. Theyâre called âSection 218 agreements.â. Congress passed a law in July 1991 extending Social. Security on a mandatory basis to most state and local. employees not covered by an agreement or a Social Security. equivalent public pension system.
